[{"instruction": "What is Samyang Buldak ramen?", "output": "Samyang Buldak ramen is a popular Korean instant ramen that is characterized by its spicy, bold flavor. It is made with chicken broth, but instead of using traditional seasonings, it uses gochujang, a kind of Korean chili paste, to give it its signature spice. Gochujang is what gives many Korean dishes their distinctive heat and flavor, so you can think of it as the soul of this dish.\n\n## Make your own spicy chicken broth\n\n1. Use chicken stock cubes or bullion cubes to make your way to the main ingredient. You will need about 4 cups (500 ml) of chicken stock cubes and 1 large cube of bullion to make your own spicy chicken broth. You can use whatever kind you prefer, but chicken stock cubes are more traditional. Beef broth would also work, but you may want to add a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to mimic the saltiness that the Worcestershire sauce provides.\n2. Heat the stock and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Use your saucepan and heat it over medium-high heat. Pour the chicken broth into the saucepan and heat it until it is boiling. Once it is boiling, turn the heat down to medium so it is gently simmering. You do not want to boil the broth too vigorously, as this could cause the stock to separate and become cloudy.\n3. Add the garlic and ginger to the hot broth. Once the broth has come to a boil, add 2 tablespoons (28.3 ml) of butter, 2 minced garlic cloves, and 2 tablespoons (28.3 ml) of grated ginger. Stir them into the hot broth for about 1 minute to infuse the broth with their flavors.\n4. Add the gochujang and mirin. Add 2 tablespoons (28.3 ml) of gochujang and 2 tablespoons (28.3 ml) of mirin to the broth. Stir the mixture well for about 1 minute to combine the flavors. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.\n5. Keep the broth warm over low heat. Once the ingredients are well combined, remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the broth to keep warm over low heat for about 15 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld even further.\n6. Strain the broth to remove the solids. If you want to drink the broth without the solids, you can strain it. To do this, ladle the broth through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the garlic, ginger, and other solids. The resulting broth should be clear and free of particles.\n7. Add the seasoning and serve. Stir in 1 teaspoon (5.8 ml) of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon (5.8 ml) of sesame oil. Serve the hot broth in a bowl and top with sliced green onions and a hard-boiled egg.", "generator": "res_gemma_3.1B_it_ep15-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Give me a recipe for tiramisu.", "output": "## Make your own tiramisu\n\nIngredients:\n* 1 box (1 pound) of fresh lasagne sheets\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon sugar\n* 2 cups heavy cream\n* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped\n\nFor the coffee syrup:\n* 1 cup coffee, brewed strong\n* 3 tablespoons sugar\n\nFor the ladyfingers:\n* 1 package (3.94 ounces) of cake konami ladyfingers\n* 1 tablespoon butter\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Before Einstein, each of these theories was successful in the region over which they were validated, but they could not be combined into a single framework.\n* It explains the behavior of matter at high speeds, a phenomenon known as high-energy particle physics.\n* It provides a theoretical foundation for many modern technologies, including GPS, nuclear energy, and cancer therapy.\n\nIn addition, the theory of relativity is a work in progress, and many open questions remain unanswered. It is stimulating new research and is leading to the discovery of new physics.\n\nHere are some of the open questions that remain unanswered in the theory of relativity:\n\n* How are gravity and electromagnetism unified in a single theory?\n* What is the source of the dark energy that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate?\n* What is the nature of dark matter?\n* Is time travel possible, and if so, what are the limitations?\n* Can relativity be extended to include quantum mechanics?\n\nThese are exciting questions that are being investigated by many scientists around the world.

While it can provide benefits such as social connection and access to information, it can also negatively impact mental health, leading to issues such as anxiety and depression.\n\n*  One key impact of social media is that it can lead to increased anxiety and depression. Studies have shown that individuals who use social media more frequently are more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. This may be due to a number of factors, including social comparison, cyberbullying, and fear of missing out (FOMO). \n\n*  Another key impact of social media is that it can negatively affect body image and self-esteem.  Social media platforms often present an unrealistic portrayal of people's bodies and lifestyles, which can lead to individuals developing negative feelings about themselves. This is particularly harmful to young people who are still developing their sense of self. \n\n*  Finally, social media can negatively impact sleep and attention span. The constant stream of notifications and updates on social media can be distracting and prevent individuals from focusing on tasks at hand.

The Agricultural Revolution: During the preceding Industrial Revolution, improvements in agricultural practices enabled a surplus of food. This surplus allowed people to eat less and for cheaper, which in turn allowed them to afford manufactured goods.\n2. The Rise of a Middle Class: As the economy became more complex, there was an increase in the middle class of factory owners, managers, and professionals. This group wanted more, and they spent money on further industrial production.\n3. Capital: The Industrial Revolution required large amounts of capital investment. This capital came in the form of loans that could be used to invest in new factories or raw materials.\n4. New Technologies: Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, many new technologies were invented that improved manufacturing. These included the spinning jenny, the power loom, and the cotton gin.\n5. Favorable Government Policies: In some countries, the governments of the time encouraged industrialization through policies such as free trade and investment in infrastructure.\n\n\n## Effects of the Industrial Revolution\n\n1. Economic Growth: The Industrial Revolution had a huge impact on the way countries produced goods and services. It led to overall economic growth as industrial nations became much richer.\n2. Rise of the Middle Class: As a result of their new money, the middle class grew in number and wealth. This middle class often became more urbanized as they sought better jobs in factories.\n3. Increased Standard of Living: The Industrial Revolution ultimately increased the standard of living for most people. As goods became cheaper and more plentiful, everyone benefited from a slightly higher standard of living.\n4. Pollution: One of the negative effects of the Industrial Revolution was that it caused serious air and water pollution. Many factories released toxic waste into the environment, and the growth of cities caused pollution as well.\n5.

The authors contend that a basic income can provide a safety net for those who lose their jobs to automation and allow individuals to take the time they need to retrain for new jobs. \n\n## Evaluate the evidence for or against the main argument\n\n1. The article mentions that \"economists say that technological advances will lead to more jobs but at a lower wage\" (p. 11). Some of these economists may be right; it is true that technological advances will create more jobs than the current system creates. However, the article does not provide any evidence for this claim.

The article mentions that a basic income could help those who lose their jobs due to automation \"avoid a downward economic spiral\" (p. 14). This is a valid concern. It is clear that a basic income could help prevent a downward economic spiral. In fact, many basic income proposals include work requirements or other requirements that those receiving benefits must meet in order to continue receiving benefits. The fact that these requirements are not work requirements on the basic income proposal indicates that the authors' argument is in favor of a basic income.\n\n3.

Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'.", "output": "## The American Dream and its Corruption in The Great Gatsby\n\nIn F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The Great Gatsby, the novel explores the disillusionment and corruption that can accompany the pursuit of the American Dream. Narrated through the eyes of Nick Carraway, the story centers on the enigmatic millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsessive quest to recapture the past. Through Nick\u2019s perspective, we see how the dream can be twisted and distorted by ego, wealth, and a romanticized notion of the past.\n\nAt its core, the Great Gatsby is a tragedy about the illusion of the American Dream. The novel suggests that the dream has been co-opted by the elite of America, who have transformed it from a promise of equality and opportunity into a tool for maintaining their dominance. Through characters like Gatsby, the novel critiques this transformation. Gatsby\u2019s entire life is dedicated to achieving the dream \u2013 to recreating the past and, in doing so, to immortalizing himself. His lavish parties, extravagant displays of wealth, and romantic entanglements are all designed to attract the attention of Daisy, who he once loved. However, in doing so, Gatsby prevents himself from fully embracing the present and the equality he once envisioned.\n\nAs the story progresses, it becomes clear that the past is not what it seems. Gatsby\u2019s idealized memories of their romance are merely an illusion, constructed to conceal the fact that their relationship ended years prior. The more Gatsby tries to hold onto the past, the more it seems to slip away, symbolized by the finality with which he dies. In his quest to recapture it, the novel suggests that the past can never be truly possessed; it can only be referenced.\n\n### The past is not what it seems\n\nGatsby\u2019s entire life is dedicated to the dream of returning to the past. He is obsessed with recreating 1917, the summer he met Daisy. Ironically, the more he tries to hold onto that past, the more he is forced to confront the reality of his present circumstances. In fact, throughout the novel, Nick observes that Gatsby is \u201chalf believing in the dream as well as in himself.\u201d This suggests that Gatsby\u2019s conception of the past is an illusion, constructed to conceal the fact that he has not recreated 1917.\n\nGatsby\u2019s dream is inextricably linked to his race and class. He is a white American, living in the South, during the Great Depression. This makes him an outsider in both worlds. In the North, he is viewed with suspicion and disdain, a \u201cnew money\u201d white who has \u201cno place in this country.\u201d In the South, he is an outsider in his own society, where old money and new money are at odds. This creates a sense of isolation and detachment for Gatsby, preventing him from fully integrating into either the old or the new worlds.\n\n### The corruption of the American Dream\n\nBeyond the tragedy of being an outsider, the American Dream\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nThe American Dream\n\nThe American Dream and wealth\n\nof\n\nThe American Dream\n\nThe\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nThe\n\nThe Great\n\nThe\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nThe\n\nThe\n\nGatsby\n\nThe\n\nThe\n\nThe\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\n##\n\n###\n\nof\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\n###\n\n###\n\nThe###\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof Gatsby###\n\ndream###\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof###\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nThe###\n\nof\n\nof\n\nAmericanDream###\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nThe###\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nThenovel'\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\n###\n\nof\n\nThe###\n\nof\n\nof\n\nThe###\n\n```The###\n\nof\n\n```\n\nThe###\n\ntitle>", "generator": "res_gemma_3.1B_it_ep15-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Create a Python program that simulates a simple banking system with functionalities for deposit, withdrawal, and account balance check.", "output": "```\nclass Account:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n        else:\n            print(\"Please enter a positive amount.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            if self.balance >= amount:\n                self.balance -= amount\n            else:\n                print(\"Not enough balance.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Please enter a positive amount.\")\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n\n# Create some accounts\naccount1 = Account(\"11111-10102\", 100)\naccount2 = Account(\"22223-12124\", 50)\naccount3 = Account(\"33335-12334\", 25)\n\n# Print the initial balance of each account\nprint(\"Initial balance of accounts:\")\nfor i, account in enumerate(Account.imported_accounts):\n    print(f\"Account {i+1}: {account.get_balance()} pounds\")\n\n# Simulate transactions\naccount1.deposit(50)\nprint(\"\\nAfter depositing 50 pounds into account 1:\")\nprint(f\"  Account 1 balance: {account1.get_balance()} pounds\")\n\naccount2.withdraw(25)\nprint(\"\\nAfter withdrawing 25 pounds from account 2:\")\nprint(f\"  Account 2 balance: {account2.get_balance()} pounds\")\n\naccount3.deposit(100)\nprint(\"\\nAfter depositing 100 pounds into account 3:\")\nprint(f\"  Account 3 balance: {account3.get_balance()} pounds\")\n\n# Demonstrate importing accounts (you can modify this to read from a file instead of using the Account object constructor)\n# accounts = [\n#     Account(\"11111-10102\", 100),\n#     Account(\"22223-12124\", 50),\n#     Account(\"33335-12334\", 25)\n# ]\n# for i, account in enumerate(accounts):\n#     print(f\"Account {i+1}: {account.get_balance()} pounds\")\n```\nThe output of the above code is:\n```\nInitial balance of accounts:\n11111-101011\nAccount(1111-101>0\nAccount.__init__(11111>10>20\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```.deposit(50\n```.deposit(50\n```\n```.get_balance()\n```.withdraw()\n```.\n```\n```.deposit(5()```.\n```>0\n>0\n```\n```\n```\n(5\n```\n```>\naccount\n```\n```5()\n```\n```,\n```\n```\n>\n```\n```\n```\n>\n```\n>5\naccount()\ndeposit(5\naccount\n>0\n>0\nprint(\"5>0\n>0\n>5\naccount.0\n>\n```\n```5\n>\n```5\n>0,\n```\n5\n```\n```,5>0\n```\n```\n```5>0|>5>\n```5>5>\n```\n>5>5|>5", "generator": "res_gemma_3.1B_it_ep15-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Explain the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in healthcare, discussing both potential benefits and risks.", "output": "## Potential benefits of AI in healthcare\n\n1.

This can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases, which has a better chance of success.\n2. Personalized treatment plans: AI can analyze a patient's genetic information, lifestyle, and medical history to develop personalized treatment plans. This can lead to more effective treatments with fewer side effects.\n3. Reduced healthcare costs: AI can automate many routine tasks, such as appointment scheduling and billing, which can reduce administrative costs. It can also improve efficiency and reduce errors, which can also reduce costs.\n4. Increased access to care: AI-powered chatbots can provide basic medical advice and triage patients, which can reduce wait times for care and make healthcare more accessible to people in rural areas or who are unable to travel.\n5. Drug discovery: AI can accelerate the drug discovery process by analyzing vast amounts of data to identify potential drug candidates and predict their effectiveness. This can lead to new treatments for diseases that take years or decades to develop using traditional methods.\n\n\n## Potential risks of AI in healthcare\n\n1. Lack of transparency: Many AI algorithms are \"black boxes,\" meaning that it is difficult or impossible to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This lack of transparency can be a problem in healthcare, where it is important for doctors to understand the reasoning behind AI recommendations before acting on them.\n2. Bias: AI algorithms are trained on data, and if that data is biased, the algorithm will be biased. For example, if the training data contains only images of white people, the algorithm will be less accurate when diagnosing diseases in people of color.\n3. Job displacement: As AI becomes more capable, it may be able to take on jobs that are currently done by humans, such as medical transcription and billing. This could lead to job losses in the healthcare industry.\n4. Privacy concerns: The use of AI in healthcare requires the collection and analysis of vast amounts of personal medical data, which raises privacy concerns. It is important to ensure that this data is protected from breaches and unauthorized use.\n5.

He also believed that people voluntarily submit to government when government is established to protect these rights.\n*   **Hobbes**, on the other hand, believed that humans are born as naturally selfish and brutish creatures. He thought that people do not have any inalienable rights, and that government is necessary to keep individuals in check from infringing on each other's rights.\n\n## Hobbes and Locke on government\n\n*   **Locke** advocated for a limited government that is responsible to the people. He believed that government should not violate the people's natural rights, and that citizens should retain the right to rebel against a government that becomes tyrannical.\n*   **Hobbes**, in contrast, argued that the purpose of government is to protect individuals within it from other individuals. He believed that government should be seen as an extension of the individual, and that citizens should be loyal and obedient to their government.\n\n**Summary**\nIn summary, both Locke and Hobbes were Enlightenment thinkers who questioned traditional political norms and institutions.

These are designated areas where businesses are required or encouraged to remove their plastic packaging and only sell products in bulk (or on request) from refillable containers with minimal or no packaging. Few cities have gone a step further by requiring PFZs to also remove plastic from their supply chain (i.e. the '10+ Piece Rule' - see below).###\n###Proposed Solution###\n1. Select 1-2 city centers that are representative of the city's overall shopping habits.\n2. Obtain building permits for businesses in the selected city center that allow bulk sales with minimal/no packaging.\n3. Charge a fee (e.g. $50-100) for businesses to apply for and be approved for a PFZ designation. The fee helps cover the cost of sign rental, education, and any penalties for non-compliance.\n4. Publicize the availability of the PFZ through the city's website, social media, and print advertising. Highlight the benefits for both businesses and the community.\n5.

The results of these studies are mixed, with some finding significant benefits and others showing little to no impact.\n\n## Potential benefits of remote work on employee productivity\n\n1. Reduced absenteeism: One of the most cited benefits of remote work is its ability to reduce employee absenteeism. As no physical presence at the workplace is required, employees are less likely to call in sick or take time off. This can increase productivity, as they are able to work when they are healthy and productive.\n2. Increased focus and concentration: A key to successful remote work is establishing a dedicated workspace free from distractions. By creating such a workspace, employees can improve their focus and concentration, leading to increased productivity.\n3. Greater work-life balance: Remote work can help employees achieve a better work-life balance. The flexibility it offers allows them to manage personal appointments and other commitments around the demands of their jobs, reducing stress and preventing burnout.\n4. Higher employee morale and engagement: By providing greater autonomy and flexibility, remote work can boost employee morale and engagement. Employees feel more trusted and valued when given remote work opportunities, leading to higher job satisfaction and retention.\n\n## Potential risks of remote work on employee productivity\n\n1. Lack of social interaction: A common criticism of remote work is that it can lead to a lack of social interaction among employees. This can negatively impact morale and productivity, as social interaction is an important part of building relationships and fostering a sense of community.\n2. Difficulty separating work from personal life: As the lines between work and personal life become blurred in a remote setting, employees may experience more stress and difficulty disengaging from work. This can ultimately decrease productivity.\n3. Reduced visibility: Some employees may feel that they are less visible to management when working remotely. This can lead to them feeling demotivated and unproductive.\n4. Inadequate technology: The quality of remote work largely depends on the quality of the infrastructure. If companies do not provide adequate technology, such as reliable internet access and secure VPNs, the benefits of remote work will be diminished or even reversed.\n\n\n## Potential benefits of remote work on employee well-being\n\n1. Reduced commuting time: One of the most obvious benefits of remote work is the reduction in commuting time. By eliminating or reducing commute-related stress, remote work can improve employee well-being.\n2. Lower operational costs: Companies that offer remote work options may experience lower operational costs, such as office space and utilities. This can be particularly beneficial for small businesses that may not be able to afford expensive office space.\n3.

In essence, the categorical imperative states that \"you ought to act only according to a maxim whereby at least one can be justified its violation.\" This maxim should be derived from reason and universalizable. If no one can be justified in violating the maxim, it has no place in an ethical system. \n\n## Strengths of the Categorical Imperative\n\n1. It provides a universal and objective standard of morality: The categorical imperative offers a rule that is valid and can be applied to everyone, everywhere, in every circumstance. Its universality is supported by the assertion that \"ought\" implies \"in order that\": we should act in a way that guarantees at least one person can be justified in the course of our actions. This does not mean that we should always act on the maxim that would be universalized, but that it should serve as a guide on occasions when we face a dilemma.\n2. It grounds morality in reason and autonomy: The maxim must be derived from reason, meaning that it should be something that we can logically arrive at through rational thought. At the same time, the maxim should respect the individual's autonomy; that is, it should not be imposed on us by external factors such as our emotions, desires, or social environment. Acting on a maxim that respects our autonomy, according to Kant, affirms our humanity. This is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the categorical imperative.\n3. It offers a constructive and positive vision of human nature: To act on a maxim that is universalizable, one must first act on one's best (or most rational) self. This means that we are not merely beasts driven by instinct; we have the capacity for reason and self-overcoming. Therefore, the categorical imperative offers a hopeful vision of what we can become and what we should strive to become as moral beings.\n4. It provides a clear and distinct boundary between duties and ends: The duty is to do a certain action, while the end is what we are trying to achieve. The categorical imperative is unique in that it draws a sharp distinction between these two. We have duties towards all, regardless of their relationship to us (e.g., a duty to one's parents versus a duty to one's country). Moreover, the duty is always to the extent that it does not violate the maxim. This means that we are not bound by our duties in the same way that we are bound by self-preservation or the avoidance of pain.\n\n\n## Weaknesses of the Categorical Imperative\n\n1. It is vague and open to multiple interpretations: The most immediate criticism of the categorical imperative is that it is too vague. Its formulation is such that different people can come up with conflicting imperatives. This is not to say that the formulation is wrong but rather that it leaves room for different validating the weakness is that it does not clearly distinguishes between duties and ends.\n2.

Increased healthcare spending: one of the most immediate effects of implementing universal healthcare is a significant increase in healthcare spending. Because everyone is required to have health insurance, at least a basic level of healthcare is available to all citizens. This increased demand will likely drive up prices for both medical services and over-the-counter drugs.\n2. Low productivity: a healthier population is likely to be a more productive population. When citizens can see a doctor when they are sick, rather than suffering in silence and potentially spreading disease, they will likely go to the doctor more often. However, the increased use of healthcare services may also lead to more frequent doctor visits, as people become aware of the preventative care services available.\n3. Job losses in the private insurance industry: the current US system relies on a private insurance industry to provide health insurance to the population. With universal healthcare, the government will take over the role of insurance provider, and significant numbers of private health insurance jobs will be eliminated.\n4. Wage effects: while a healthy population is more productive, a universal healthcare system may also put downward pressure on wages. In a system where everyone is entitled to a basic level of healthcare, employers may try to reduce labor costs by not offering health insurance at all, or by offering less comprehensive plans than in the current private system.\n5. Return to cash: a negative cash flow for the private insurance industry, coupled with fixed costs of the insurance industry, may force some to go bankrupt and/or transfer patients to the government-run system.\n\n\n## Long-term economic effects\n\n1. Improved public health: universal healthcare will likely lead to a longer life expectancy and a lower infant mortality rate. When healthcare is a right, rather than a privilege, there is a greater incentive for people to take care of their health. This will increase the population as a whole, and also keep people healthier for longer.\n2. Economic growth: a healthier population is a more productive population, which will lead to greater long-term economic growth. Additionally, the increased tax revenue from a larger population will allow the government to fund universal healthcare at a basic level, and to invest in other areas of the economy.\n3. Increased human capital: with universal healthcare, low-income individuals will have access to basic health insurance. This allows them to work longer hours, and take more risks, knowing that they have health insurance to fall back on if they get sick. This increased risk-taking will ultimately lead to more innovation and economic growth.\n4. Reduced inequality: universal healthcare will reduce health and wealth inequality. The current US system allows for vast disparities in access to healthcare. The government-run system will ensure that everyone is entitled to basic health insurance. This will help to level the playing field for those who are already healthy, and allow unhealthy individuals to keep polluting the healthcare spending.", "generator": "res_gemma_3.1B_it_ep15-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Design an educational curriculum for a high school course on climate science, including key topics, learning objectives, and assessment methods.", "output": "## High School Climate Science Course Outline\n\n###Introduction (1 week) \n* What is climate science?\n* Why is climate science important?\n* Overview of the course\n\n###Data Collection and Analysis (2 weeks) \n* Meteorology: Weather and climate\n* Climatology: Long-term trends and patterns\n* Modeling climate systems\n* Uncertainty analysis in climate science\n\n###Communication of Scientific Information (1 week) \n* Tailoring scientific information to different audiences\n* Persuading and influencing others about climate science\n\n###Sustainability and Climate Action (1 week) \n* The greenhouse effect and climate change\n* Mitigation: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n* Adaptation: Adjusting to the effects of climate change\n* International climate agreements\n\n###Independent Study/Project (1 week) \n* Students choose an aspect of climate science that interests them\n* Students conduct independent research\n* Students prepare and present their findings to the class\n\n###Assessment (1 week) \n* Class participation (10%)\n* Homework assignments (10%)\n* Quizzes (20%)\n* Midterm exam (10%)\n* Final exam (40%)\n\n###Resources \n* NASA Climate Kids: [Insert link]\n* National Geographic Education: Climate Change: [Insert link]\n* Science Buddies: Climate Change [Insert link]\n\n###Differentiation \n* Provide extra support for students who need it\n* Challenge students who are ready for more\n* Offer flexible assessment options to meet their needs\n\n###Inclusivity \n* Ensure that all students feel welcome and respected in the classroom\n* Use inclusive language and avoid jargon\n* Provide translations of key concepts into other languages\n\n###Ethics \n* Discuss the ethical issues surrounding climate science (e.g. climate change denialism, climate change mitigation vs. climate action)\n\n###Civil Engineering and Climate Science \n* Basic introduction to climate models and their limitations\n\n###Elective Course (1 week) \n* Students can use this course to explore other areas of science and engineering that are related to climate science\n\n###Final Project (1 week) \n* Students work on an independent project related to climate science\n\n###Grading Rubric \n* This will vary depending on the assignment, but here is an example for an essay:\n* Thesis statement (20%)\n* Evidence for the thesis (40%)\n* Reasoning and explanation (20%)\n* Organization and clarity (10%)\n* Grammar and mechanics (10%)\n\n###Differentiation of Assessment \n* Provide extra support for students who need it\n* Challenge students who are ready for more\n* Offer flexible assessment options to meet their needs\n\n###Inclusivity \n* Ensure that all students feel welcome in the classroom\n* Use inclusive language\n\n###Civil Engineering and Climate Science\n\n###Introduction (1 week) \n* What is a climate model?\nClimate model, and why it is important\n\n###", "generator": "res_gemma_3.1B_it_ep15-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Compare the artistic styles and contributions of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo to the Renaissance period.", "output": "Both Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were quintessential figures of the High Renaissance, and while they worked in different fields (art and science respectively), their styles and contributions shared striking similarities.\n\n* Art historical period: both men were masters of their time, active during the same era (1480-1570), and were considered among the most important artists of the period.\n* Scientific study of human anatomy: da Vinci was the first modern scientist to openly study human anatomy, meticulously documenting the structure of the human body in his drawings. This study of the human body was ahead of its time, and influenced anatomical drawings for centuries to come. Similarly, Michelangelo also made detailed anatomical studies of the human body in his sculptures and paintings, although his approach was more focused on representation than da Vinci's more exploratory approach.\n* Engineering and invention: da Vinci was a brilliant engineer and inventor, designing and building numerous contraptions and machines that were centuries ahead of their time, including a flying machine, a tank, and an early form of the computer. Michelangelo also designed and built several public structures, including a massive statue of David that dominated the Piazza del Campidoglio for centuries afterward.\n* Approach to art: both men were known for their innovative approach to art, which emphasized the individual artist's creativity and genius. da Vinci was the quintessential \"Renaissance man,\" excelling in art, science, and engineering, and believed that artists should be scientists as well, studying anatomy and the natural world to better represent the human form. Michelangelo, while more focused on the representation of the human form, also embraced the idea of the artist as a genius who created original works of art.\n\nwatermelon-sculpture: it was this very idea that informed da Vinci's famous statement, \"I never knew the human form so well, had myself no knowledge of anatomy, but had it not, could not hope to represent it with accuracy so as to give the viewer the impression of its perfect beauty and harmony.\" this statement, often repeated to this day, immortalizes da Vinci's genius and his profound understanding of the human form.\n\nin contrast to da Vinci, who saw the artist as an active agent in the creative process, shaping and molding the beautiful ideal that he was to represent, michelangelo viewed the artist as a passive recipient of the divine spark, the patron of the gods who brought the form into being. this difference in perspective on the artist's role in art reflects a deeper difference in their philosophical outlook on the world, which placed greater faith in the divine than in the human. for da Vinci, the universe was ordered and rational, with each thing having a specific purpose, while for michelangelo, the universe was more chaotic and irrational, with no inherent purpose or order.\n\nwatermelon-sculpture. da vinci's idea was to approach the creation of a work of art with the same mindset that he would have approached the creation of a sculpture. his first step was to study anatomy in order to understand the form as michelangelo believed da Vinci and Michelangelo.\n\n* artistic styles and subjects: da vinci>\nartisticus\n\nHowever, theic arts andicelandi and scientific study of the High Renaissance period, andicence, their respective fields, science andicence> and Michelangelo, andic their respective> and Michelangelo, Michelangelo,ic arts and Leonardo da Vinci>\nMichelangelo andic).

This study will investigate the impact of environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics (MPs) on a range of ecologically important species in a controlled mesocosm environment. Our hypotheses are that exposure to MPs will cause a range of effects, including physical damage, reduced growth, and altered behavior. If our hypotheses are correct, this research will provide critical data to inform risk assessments of microplastic pollution in marine environments.\n\n###Introduction\nThe term \"marine plastic pollution\" refers to the presence of plastic debris in the ocean. This debris can originate from land-based sources, such as wastewater treatment plants, and can be transported over long distances by ocean currents. Once in the ocean, plastic debris can be ingested by a wide range of organisms, leading to physical damage, bioaccumulation in the food chain, and ultimately, ecosystem disruption.\n\nMicroplastics (MPs), plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are a particularly concerning type of plastic pollution due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment and their potential to cause significant damage to marine life. Exposure to MPs can occur through ingestion, where organisms mistaking the plastic for food become poisoned, and through deposition, where organisms are exposed to MPs that are subsequently ingested. Experimental evidence for the toxic effects of MPs is growing, with many studies reporting a range of adverse effects following short-term and/or long-term exposure. However, few studies have examined the effects of MPs on a range of ecologically important species in a natural environment.\n\nThis study will address this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs on a range of species in a mesocosm.\n\n###Objectives\nThe objectives of this study are to:\n\n* Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of MPs on a range of ecologically important species.\n* Investigate the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the observed toxicity.\n* Identify the thresholds of exposure below which adverse effects do occur.\n\n###Hypotheses\nWe hypothesize that:\n\n* Exposure to MPs will cause a range of effects, including physical damage, reduced growth, and altered behavior.\n\n###Methodology\nThis study will be conducted in a mesocosm facility that will be used to study the effects of pollution on a range of organisms in a natural environment. The mesocosm will be equipped with the following instrumentation:\n\n* A recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) that will allow for the addition of MPs to the system.\n* A water quality monitor that will allow for the monitoring of pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen.\n* A temperature log that will allow for the monitoring of water temperature.\n* A camera that will allow for the visual documentation of the study.\n\nOrganisms of interest will include:\n\n* Copepods (small fish)\n* \n* \nPlankton\n*\n###Materials and methods\nPrepare a set-up\n###Results\nPrepare a figure", "generator": "res_gemma_3.1B_it_ep15-greedy-long"}]
