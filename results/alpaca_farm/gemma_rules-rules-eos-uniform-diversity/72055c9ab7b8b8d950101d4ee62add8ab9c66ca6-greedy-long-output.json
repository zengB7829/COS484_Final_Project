I have a dark secret: I used to be a LARPer. LARPing is Live Action Role Playing, and it's just about what it sounds like: running around in costume, talking in a funny accent, pretending to be a super-spy or a vampire or a medieval knight. It's like Capture the Flag in monster-drag, with a bit of Drama Club thrown in, and the best games were the ones we played in Scout Camps out of town in Sonoma or down on the Peninsula. Those three-day epics could get pretty hairy, with all-day hikes, epic battles with foam-and-bamboo swords, casting spells by throwing beanbags and shouting 'Fireball!' and so on. Good fun, if a little goofy. Not nearly as geeky as talking about what your elf planned on doing as you sat around a table loaded with Diet Coke cans and painted miniatures, and more physically active than going into a mouse-coma in front of a massively multiplayer game at home.\n\nPlease summarize it in 5 words or less.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Please provide a short, detailed vacation plan for a 2-day trip to the virtual world of Code Lyoko.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "What is 17 multiplied by 24, divided by 8, and then subtract 3?", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Summarize the story of 'Cinderella' in one sentence.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "If today is July 2, 2024, what day of the week will July 9, 2024, be?", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Rewrite the sentence 'The cat sat on the mat' without using the words 'cat', 'sat', or 'mat'.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Translate the sentence 'Hello, how are you?' into Spanish.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "What is the antonym of the word 'happy'?", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "List five fruits that are red in color.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Sort these numbers in ascending order: 45, 12, 78, 4, 23.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "What is the capital city of Japan?", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Fill in the blank: The quick brown fox ___ over the lazy dog.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Compose a short poem about the ocean.", "output": "", "generator": "72055c9ab7b8b8d950101d4ee62add8ab9c66ca6-greedy-long"}, {"instruction": "Translate the following paragraph into French: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
