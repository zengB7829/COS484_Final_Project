Here's a breakdown of the key influences:\n*   **Indigenous Peoples:** The first names were given by the indigenous peoples who inhabited the land before European settlement. These names often reflected the natural environment or the people's way of life.\n*   **English Surnames:** As English colonization progressed, English surnames became increasingly common. These surnames were often descriptive of the land or the person who possessed them.\n*   **Place Names:** As settlers moved to new areas, they would often use place names from their home regions to name the new settlements.\n*   **Early Governors and Officials:** The names of early governors and officials also influenced state names, often based on their titles or the regions they represented.\n*   **The Great Seal:** The Great Seal of the United States, adopted in 1782, was a key factor in the naming process. It was designed to be a symbol of the new nation and its values, and it included a list of approved names.\n*   **State Constitutions:** The state constitutions of each state also played a role in the naming process, as they often included provisions for the use of approved names.\n*   **Popularity and Tradition:** Over time, some names gained popularity and became widely accepted, while others remained relatively obscure. The use of these names was often a matter of tradition.\n*   **Modernization:** In the 20th and 21st centuries, there has been a renewed interest in the history of state names, and some states have been given new names to honor their past."}, {"instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Kickball is a fast-paced game played with a ball and a bat, and it's all about running the bases and scoring runs. Here's a breakdown of how it's played:\n\n1.  **Starting the game:** The game begins with a round of batting and running. The first person to get three bases before getting out is the first person to score a run.\n2.  **Rolling the bases:** The ball is passed from one base to the next, and each base is a \"base\" in the game. When a player reaches a base, they must run to the next base before the ball can be passed to the next person.\n3.  **Scoring a run:** A player scores a run by running to a base and touching the base with the ball before the next person touches the base with the bat.\n4.  **Outs:** A player can be \"out\" in several ways:\n    *   Being hit by the ball while running.\n    *   Being tagged out while running.\n    *   Being caught between two bases while running.\n    *   Being out of a base while running.\n5.  **No-outs:** If a player is not out while running, they can be out by a no-out. This means the next person to run to the base must touch the base with the bat before the next person can touch the base with the ball.\n6.  **Winning the game:** The first team to score 7 runs wins the game. If the game is tied after 7 rounds, it goes into extra innings. Extra innings are played until one team scores a run. The team that scores the most runs at the end wins.\n\nKickball is a lot of fun, but it's important to know the rules so you don't get taken advantage of. If you're new to the game, ask your sister or her friends to teach you the rules before you go play. Good luck, and have fun!"}, {"instruction": "What is some cool music from the 1920s?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "- \"Charleston\" by J.P.

"output": "Retinoids are a very effective treatment for acne, and many people find them to be quite effective. They work by increasing skin cell turnover, which can help to unclog pores and reduce inflammation. Some retinoids are also available in over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription forms, and the best option for you will depend on the severity of your acne and your skin type. If you have a lot of acne, you may want to start with a low-strength retinoid and gradually increase the strength as your skin tolerates it. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to start with a non-retinoid treatment, such as a benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, to help reduce the inflammation before using a retinoid.\nIt\u2019s important to use retinoids consistently and for the recommended amount of time to see the best results. Retinoids can cause side effects, such as dryness, redness, and peeling, but these are usually temporary. If you experience any bothersome side effects, stop using the retinoid and talk to your doctor.\nDo you want me to help you find some specific retinoids that might be right for you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm trying to teach myself to have nicer handwriting.

This will help you breathe easier and write more comfortably. \r\n*   **Grip:** Hold your pen or pencil loosely between your thumb and index finger, with your middle finger curled under and your ring finger and pinky finger curled over the top of the pen. \r\n*   **Paper Position:** Place the paper at a slight angle, so the paper is not flat against your body. \r\n*   **Pressure:** Apply even pressure to the paper with your pen or pencil. Don\u2019t press too hard or too lightly. \r\n*   **Slant:** A slight slant is good for legibility, but don\u2019t overdo it. \r\n*   **Loops and Curves:** Practice making smooth, flowing loops and curves. Start by making a small loop and gradually increase the size. \r\n*   **Letter Formation:** Start with the basic shapes of letters and gradually add more detail. \r\n*   **Spacing:** Don\u2019t be afraid to leave some space between letters and words. \r\n*   **Practice:** The more you practice, the better you\u2019ll get. \r\n*   **Tools:** A good pen or pencil is important. A ballpoint pen is fine to start with, but a felt-tip pen or a brush pen will give you more control and a more natural look. \r\n*   **Resources:** There are many free handwriting tutorials online. Some popular ones include: [https://www.handwritingpractice.com/](https://www.handwritingpractice.com/) and [https://www.thehandwritingcommunity.com/](https://www.thehandwritingcommunity.com/). \r\n*   **Don\u2019t Give Up:** It takes time to improve your handwriting, so don\u2019t get discouraged if you don\u2019t see results immediately. Just keep practicing, and you\u2019ll eventually get there. \r\n*   **Experiment:** Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with different pen and paper positions, grips, and styles to find what works best for you. \r\n*   **Be Patient:** The most important thing is to be patient with yourself and enjoy the process. \r\n\r\nTo help me give you more specific advice, could you tell me:\r\n*   What kind of writing do you want to improve? (e.g., letters, words, or entire pages?)\r\n*   What kind of pen do you use? (e.g., ballpoint, felt-tip, etc.)"}, {"instruction": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting.

The turkey, being a large and adaptable bird, would have been a convenient choice for the occasion.\n- In 16th-century England, the turkey was considered a lucky bird, and it was often given as a gift to royalty and the wealthy. This association with good fortune may have led to the turkey becoming a symbol of abundance and prosperity, which would have been fitting for a harvest celebration.\n- The Dutch brought turkeys to America in the 17th century, and they quickly became popular with settlers. The turkey's hardiness and ability to thrive in various climates may have made it an ideal choice for a new and challenging environment.\n- In 1854, a New York butcher named John C. Fry is credited with popularizing the turkey as the centerpiece of Thanksgiving dinner. He is said to have been so impressed with the bird's size and flavor that he named it after the president of the United States, who was then in the process of being elected.\n- The turkey's association with harvest and abundance may have been further cemented by the fact that turkeys are typically raised in flocks, which is a common practice in the agricultural sector during the fall harvest season.\nNo matter the exact origin, the turkey's association with Thanksgiving has become deeply ingrained in American culture, and it's a tradition that continues to this day."}, {"instruction": "I want to get better at networking at work", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Networking at work can feel like a numbers game, but it\u2019s really about building relationships.

The process is complex, but here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1.  **Mantle Plumes:** The Earth's mantle is a thick layer beneath the crust. Deep within the mantle, there are plumes of hot rock that rise and descend. These plumes are thought to be the primary source of heat for volcanoes.\n\n2.  **Subduction Zones:** At subduction zones, where one tectonic plate slides beneath another, water and other volatile substances are released into the mantle. These substances lower the melting point of the mantle rock, causing it to melt and form magma.\n\n3.  **Magma Ascent:** The magma, being less dense than the surrounding rock, begins to rise through the Earth's crust.\n\n4.  **Eruption:** As the magma nears the surface, the pressure decreases, and the dissolved gases within it begin to expand. This causes the magma to erupt, spewing forth in various forms, such as lava, ash, and gases.\n\n5.  **Plate Tectonics:** The movement of tectonic plates plays a crucial role in the formation of volcanoes. When plates collide, the underlying mantle material can melt, creating new volcanoes. When plates separate, magma can rise to fill the gap, forming a chain of volcanoes.\n"}, {"instruction": "Hi, I have some falafel, but no tahini to put on them.

I'm so exhausted.", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Okay, let's talk about this. You're exhausted, and that's a valid reason to consider a nanny. It's a big decision, and you shouldn't rush into it. But, you're right to be thinking about it. Here's a breakdown of things to consider:\n\n**1. Your Needs and Priorities:**\n\n*   **How much time can you realistically dedicate to a nanny?** This is the most important question. Are you looking for someone to watch your kids 24/7, or just for a few hours a week?\n*   **What are your expectations?** Do you want someone who's good at everything, or just excels in certain areas (like cooking or arts & crafts)?\n*   **What's your budget?** Nanny rates vary *significantly* based on experience, location, and the nanny's qualifications. Research average rates in your area.\n*   **What are your family's values?** Do you want someone who's religious, politically active, or has a particular lifestyle?\n\n**2. The Nanny You're Considering:**\n\n*   **Check References:** This is *crucial*. Don't just accept a reference; call the person and ask about their interactions with your children.\n*   **Meet with the Candidate:** Schedule a meeting with the nanny to see if you feel comfortable with them. Ask about their experience with children of your children's ages and personalities.\n*   **Trial Period:** If possible, arrange a short trial period (even a few hours) so you can see how they interact with your kids in a real-world setting.\n\n**3. The Financial Aspect:**\n\n*   **Nanny Rates:** As mentioned, rates vary. A good rule of thumb is to pay a minimum of 25% of your child's pay in taxes, but this can vary depending on the state and the nanny's qualifications.\n*   **Benefits:** Some nannies offer benefits like paid time off, health insurance, and retirement plans. Factor these into your budget.\n\n**4. Legal Considerations:**\n\n*   **Background Checks:** You'll need to run a background check on any nanny you hire.\n*   **Bonding:** Some states require nannies to be bonded, which means they'll be responsible for any damages or injuries that occur while they're caring for your children.\n*   **Contracts:** Get a written contract that outlines the nanny's duties, pay rate, hours worked, and any other terms of employment.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **Care.com:** [https://www.care.com/](https://www.care.com/)\n*   **Sitter.com:** [https://www.sitter.com/](https://www.sitter)\n*   **Nanny:** [https://www.nanny.com/](https://www.nanny.com)"}, {"instruction": "When was Canada colonized?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Canada was colonized by the French in the 17th century.

Here's a breakdown of the key milestones:\n* **Ancient Observations (Before 1500):**  Early civilizations like the Babylonians and Egyptians had some rudimentary ideas about the earth's shape. The Babylonians, for example, believed the earth was flat and covered a firmament (dome) above it. The Egyptians, while also believing in a flat earth, had some understanding of the sun's path across the sky.\n* **Greek Philosophers (5th Century BC):** The Greeks, particularly Aristotle, were the first to seriously propose a spherical earth. Aristotle's work, combined with the work of other Greek philosophers like Pythagoras, laid the foundation for the scientific understanding of the earth's shape.\n* **Eratosthenes (3rd Century BC):** Eratosthenes, an Athenian scholar, made the most accurate measurement of the earth's circumference during his time. He calculated the earth's diameter to be about 10,000 (or 1/8 of the distance from the sun to the earth) and that it had a radius of about 5,000 (or 1/4 of the distance from the sun to the earth). He then used the fact that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun was directly overhead, casting a square shadow in his city of Alexandria, to determine the earth's diameter.\n* **Islamic Scholars (8th-13th Centuries):** Arab scholars, working in translation and interpretation of Greek texts, further refined the understanding of the earth's shape. Al-Biruni, for example, used Eratosthenes' work and further refined the calculation of the earth's circumference.\n* **The Heliocentric Revolution (16th-17th Centuries):** The most significant shift came with the heliocentric model proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543. Copernicus's model placed the sun at the center of the solar system, with the earth and other planets revolving around it. This model was initially met with resistance from the Church, which clung to the geocentric model (earth-centered) that had been the dominant view for centuries.\n* **Galileo Galilei and the Telescope (17th Century):** Galileo's observations with the telescope provided further evidence for the heliocentric model. He observed that the moon, and later Jupiter and the other planets, orbited the sun, not the earth.\n* **Johannes Kepler and the Laws of Planetary Motion (17th Century):** Johannes Kepler built upon the work of Galileo and further refined the laws of planetary motion, which describe how planets move around the sun.\n\n\nWhy did people initially believe the earth was flat?\nThe earth was a flat disc?

This could have increased survival rates by promoting cooperation and reducing conflict.\n3.  **Cognitive Benefits:** Religious belief may have conferred cognitive benefits, such as increased attention, reduced anxiety, and a sense of purpose.\n4.  **Evolutionary Psychology:** This perspective argues that religious beliefs are adaptive because they are often culturally transmitted and reinforced through social learning.\n5.  **Illusionism:** This view suggests that religious beliefs are not based on any real-world content but are instead a product of the brain's attempt to make sense of the world.\n\n\nIt's important to note that the evolutionary explanations for religious belief are not mutually exclusive and may have all contributed to its persistence.

It began in 47 BC, when Caesar was in Egypt to secure grain supplies for his army. He was immediately captivated by her beauty and intelligence, and they began a series of meetings and visits. \r\nTheir relationship progressed into a passionate and intimate one, which was both sensual and intellectual. Caesar was fascinated by her knowledge of philosophy, particularly the works of Plato and Aristotle, and she was drawn to his strength and ambition. \r\nThey had a child together, a son named Caesarion, whom Caesar placed on his lap to be groomed for kingship. \r\nHowever, their relationship was not without its complications. Caesar was a Roman citizen and therefore subject to Roman law, which forbade marriage between a Roman and a non-Roman. Cleopatra was a queen of Egypt and therefore subject to Egyptian law, which also forbade such unions. \r\nIn 47 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators who feared his growing power. Cleopatra, upon hearing of Caesar's death, fled to Egypt and took control of the country. \r\nShe ruled as pharaoh for a time, but eventually, she was forced to move the capital of Egypt to Alexandria, which was under the control of the Roman prefect of Egypt, Mark Antony. \r\nThe two became lovers again, and they had a child together, a son named Ptolemy XIII. \r\nHowever, Ptolemy XIII was a tyrant and eventually killed his own brother, who was the rightful heir to the throne. \r\nIn 51 BC, Antony and Cleopatra formed a political alliance to overthrow the Roman power in Egypt. \r\nThey were betrayed by both Octavian (Caesar's heir) and Mark Antony, who were secretly allied with each other. \r\nIn 44 BC, Antony and Cleopatra took their own lives by suicide, ending their love affair and the reign of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. \r\nThe story of their relationship has been romanticized and embellished over the centuries, but it is a tragic tale of ambition, love, and betrayal."}, {"instruction": "Hi, I'm in the mood for a Bloody Mary.

and the best method will depend on your preferences and the location where you\u2019re scattering them.

They come in various sizes and are available at most garden centers and online.\r\n*   **Diffuser Sponges:** These are larger than scatter sponges and hold about a cupful of ashes. They\u2019re a bit more expensive but offer a more even distribution of the ashes.\r\n*   **Small Bags:** You can buy small bags of ashes and scatter them in the air. This is a good option if you\u2019re scattering ashes in a large area.\r\n*   **Personalized Memorials:** You can create a personalized memorial that includes a photo and a message. You can scatter the ashes in the memorial at a graveside or in a special garden.\r\n*   **Wind Chimes:** You can create a wind chime that incorporates ashes and is meant to be hung in a breeze.\r\n*   **Fire Pits:** If you have access to a fire pit, you can scatter the ashes in the fire and watch them burn.\r\n*   **Specialized Scattering Services:** Some companies offer specialized services for scattering ashes, such as using a drone or a hot air balloon.\r\n*   **Using a Handheld Shovel:** Some people use a handheld shovel to scoop ashes into a container and then scatter them in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Fan:** Some people use a small fan to blow ashes into the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Garden Hose:** Some people use a small garden hose to direct the airflow and scatter the ashes in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Drone:** Some people use a small drone to carry ashes and scatter them in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Helicopter:** Some people use a small helicopter to carry ashes and scatter them in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Plane:** Some people use a small plane to carry ashes and scatter them in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Boat:** Some people use a small boat to carry ashes and scatter them in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Umbrella:** Some people use a small umbrella to direct the airflow and scatter the ashes in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Umbrella with a Fan:** Some people use a small umbrella with a built-in fan to scatter the ashes in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Balloon:** Some people use a small balloon to carry ashes and scatter them in the air.\r\n*   **Using a Small Umbrella with a Small Fan:** Some people use a small fan to direct the airflow and scatter the ashes in the air.\r\n*   Scatter Sponges:\r\n*   Scatter Sponges are small and come in a variety of sizes."}, {"instruction": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting.

In fact, they were often caught after years of planning and preparation. Some of the factors that allowed serial killers to evade capture in the 70s and 80s include:\r\n*   **The \"Dark Triad\" Personality:** Serial killers often possess a combination of the \"Dark Triad\" personality traits, which include a lack of empathy, a tendency towards manipulation, and a desire for power. These traits made it easier for them to lie, deceive, and control others.\r\n*   **Planning and Preparation:** Serial killers are meticulous planners and spend a significant amount of time thinking about their crimes before they actually commit them. They often research their victims, their methods, and the police.\r\n*   **Co-conspirators:** Serial killers often have accomplices who help them carry out their plans. These co-conspirators may be unaware of the crimes they are helping to commit.\r\n*   **The \"Butterfly Effect\":** Some researchers believe that serial killers are not truly evil but are driven by a combination of factors, such as a desire for attention, a need for control, and a lack of empathy. These factors can lead to a series of seemingly random acts of violence, which can be difficult to understand or predict.\r\n*   **Police Tactics:** In the 70s and 80s, law enforcement agencies were not as sophisticated as they are today. They often relied on old-fashioned methods of investigation, such as interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence. They were also less familiar with the psychology of serial killers.\r\n*   **The \"Stigma\" of the Past:** The stigma associated with the past may have made it more difficult for law enforcement to take serial killers seriously. In the 70s and 80s, there was a greater acceptance of violence and crime, which may have led to a lack of urgency in investigating these cases.\r\n*   **Lack of Forensic Technology:** Forensic technology was not as advanced in the 70s and 80s as it is today. This made it more difficult to gather and analyze evidence, which may have hindered the investigation of serial killers.\r\n*   **The \"Good Cop/Bad Cop\" Effect:** In some cases, law enforcement agencies may have used the \"good cop/bad cop\" technique, where one officer would be more aggressive and confrontational than the other. This may have led to the escalation of violence and the failure of law enforcement to stop the killer.\r\n*   **The \"False Leads\":** In some cases, law enforcement agencies may have been led astray by false leads, which may have caused them to waste time and resources.\r\n*   **The \"Unspeakable\"**\r\n    The 7s and 8s\r\n    The 80s and 80s\r\n    The 80000"}, {"instruction": "How do I make apple juice?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "- 3 pounds (1.3 kg) apples (preferably a mix of varieties)\n - 1 cup (250 ml) water\n - 1 cup (250 ml) sugar\n - 1 cup (250 ml) apple cider vinegar\n - 1 cup (250 ml) filtered water\n\n\nPeel, core, and cut the apples into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.

How were they created?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The history of the airplane is a long and fascinating one, with many brilliant minds contributing to its development. Here's a breakdown of how they were created:\r\n* **Early Concepts (18th-19th Centuries):** The dream of flight dates back to the 18th century with Leonardo da Vinci's sketches of ornithopters (machines that imitated birds in flight). However, these were impractical due to their large size and lack of control.\r\n* **The Wright Brothers (1903-1933):** The most famous chapter in aviation history is the work of the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur. They were inventors, test pilots, and engineers who made the first sustained, controlled, powered heavier-than-air flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. They built and tested a series of gliders, gradually refining their designs.\r\n* **Early Airplane Designs (1910s-1930s):** After the Wright brothers' success, many other inventors and engineers worked on improving airplane design. These included:\r\n    * **Santos-Galiz (1913):** A French engineer who designed the first practical airplane.\n    * **Henry\u05de\u05df-Wick (1916):** A British engineer who designed the first airplane with a fixed wing.\n    * **Glenn Curtiss (1920s):** A American inventor who designed the first airplane with ailerons (wing flaps) for control.\n    * **Samuel Langley (1920s):** A American inventor who designed the first airplane with a rotating wing.\n* **World War I and the Rise of Aviation (1914-1918):** The First World War spurred rapid advancements in aircraft design. The need for faster, more maneuverable aircraft led to the development of:\r\n    * **The monoplane:** A plane with a single wing and a fuselage (body) that ran along the length of the wing.\n    * **The propeller:** A rotating wing that generates thrust by pushing air backward.\n    * **Theiler (or \"nose-mounted rudder\"):** A small rudder attached to the front of the plane that could be moved to control yaw (left-right rotation).\n* **The Golden Age of Aviation (1930s-1950s):** The 1930s and 1940s saw the development of the jet engine, which would revolutionize air travel. The development of the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-3 marked the beginning of the jet age.\r\n* **The Jet Age (1950s-Present):** The 1950s saw the development of the jet engine, which would revolutionize air travel. The 1950s saw the development of the first large jet airliner.

Instead, the ink is absorbed into the paper as you write. The pen has a built-in mechanism that allows you to add more ink as needed. The process is called \"refilling.\" It's a bit of a learning curve, but I'll walk you through it:\r\n1.  First, you need to remove the nib from the pen. To do this, hold the pen with the nib in your hand and press the plunger down to release the nib. Then, pull the nib out of the pen.\r\n2.  Next, you need to remove the ink cartridge from the pen. The cartridge is a small plastic tube that holds the ink. To remove it, you will need to pull the cartridge straight out of the pen.\r\n3.  Now you need to refill the pen. You will need to pull the nib out of the pen again, then push the nib into the ink cartridge until you feel it lock into place. You will then need to pull the cartridge straight out of the pen again.\r\n4.  Finally, you need to reinsert the nib into the pen and test it to make sure it's working.\r\n5.

Can you explain how the game works?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Okay, let's break down the basics of ice hockey. It's a fast-paced, physical game played on ice with the goal of scoring by shooting a hard rubber disc, called a puck, into the opposing team's net. Here's a rundown of the key elements:\n\n**1. The Teams and Positions:**\n\n*   Two teams of six players each (including the goalie).\n*   Positions:\n    *   **Forwards:** These players primarily try to score goals. They have different roles:\n        *   **Center:** The playmaker and often the most skilled forward.\n        *   **Left Wing:** Typically faster and more skilled than the right wing.\n        *   **Right Wing:** Generally stronger and more skilled than the left wing.\n        *   **Left Side:** A more skilled and often faster player on the left side of the ice.\n    *   **Defensemen:** These players primarily try to prevent the other team from scoring. They are skilled in skating, stickhandling, and positioning. They can play any of the forward positions.\n    *   **Goalie:** The only player who doesn't have a stick; their job is to stop the puck from entering the net.\n\n\n**2. Gameplay - The Three Zones:**\n\nThe game is divided into three distinct zones on the ice:\n\n*   **The Offensive Zone:** The team with the puck is in this zone. They have the primary goal of moving the puck down the ice and creating scoring chances.\n*   **The Defensive Zone:** The team with the puck is in this zone. They are trying to prevent the other team from scoring and defend their own goal.\n*   **The Neutral Zone:** The area between the two zones. It's a bit of a free-for-all where players can skate and pass the puck.\n\n\n**3. How the Game Progresses:**\n\n*   **Power Play:** When a team is short-handed (i.e., they have a player in the penalty box), the other team gets a \"power play.\" This means they have more offensive pressure and are generally more aggressive.\n*   **Face-off:** After a goal or a stoppage of play, the referee drops the puck between two opposing players who face each other. This starts a face-off, where players battle for possession of the puck.\n*   **Checking:** Players can use their body to impede the progress of the puck or an opponent. It's a fairly aggressive part of the game, and there are rules to prevent excessive or dangerous checks.\n*   **Slaps:** A slap is a check where a player makes contact with an opponent's body while the puck is in their stick. It's a penalty.\n*   **I'm going to play ice hockey.

Can you explain the game to me?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Okay, let's learn how to play racquetball! It's a fast-paced, action-packed sport that's great for fitness and a fun way to spend an afternoon. Here's a breakdown of the game:\n\n**1. The Basics: The Court and Equipment**\n\n*   **The Court:** The court is a smaller, faster-paced version of a tennis court, 21 feet long and 12 feet wide. It\u2019s divided into two halves by a net.\n*   **Racquetballs:** Racquetballs are smaller and lighter than tennis balls and have a rubberized surface. They bounce higher and travel faster.\n*   **Glove:** A racquetball glove is a must-have. It\u2019s designed to fit snugly over your hand and protect your palm from the ball\u2019s impact.\n*   **Shoes:** Racquetball shoes have a flat sole and a small, flexible sole that allows for quick turns and changes in direction.\n\n\n**2. The Serve**\n\n*   The serve is a key element of racquetball. It\u2019s a short, quick rally that starts with a serve.\n*   The server stands behind the baseline and hits the ball before it bounces.\n*   The receiver must hit the ball before it bounces twice.\n*   There are two types of serves: the \"short serve\" and the \"long serve.\" The short serve is a quick, low-hitting serve, while the long serve is a higher-hitting serve.\n\n\n**3. The Rally**\n\n*   After the serve, the rally begins with a volley (a hit before the ball bounces twice).\n*   Players can only hit the ball once before it bounces twice.\n*   The goal of the rally is to hit the ball before it bounces twice, and to hit it with power and accuracy.\n*   There are no faults in racquetball, meaning you can\u2019t fault your opponent for hitting the ball out of bounds or into the net.\n\n\n**4. Scoring**\n\n*   A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball before it bounces twice.\n*   A point is also scored if a player hits the ball out of bounds or into the net.\n*   A game is won by the first player to reach 11 points, with a two-point lead.\n\n\n**5. Basic Strokes**\n\n*   **Forehand Drive:** The most common racquetball stroke. It\u2019s a powerful, straight-line shot that starts from the forehand side of the body.\n*   **Backhand Drive:** Used when you don\u2019t have a clear forehand position.\n*   **Push:** A short, quick shot used to move the ball across the court.\n*   **Drop Shot:** A shot that is hit from the side of the body.\n*   **Serve:** Used to hit the ball before it bounces twice.\n\n\n**Tips for beginners:\r\n*"}, {"instruction": "What are some  good books to buy for a sci fi fan?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Okay, here are some great sci-fi books, broken down by subgenre and with a little something for everyone:\r\n*   **Space Opera:** *Dune* by Frank Herbert (A classic, a must-read for any sci-fi fan)\n*   **Cyberpunk:** *Neuromancer* by William Gibson (The quintessential cyberpunk novel)\n*   **Dystopian:** *The Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood (A chilling look at a totalitarian future)\n*   **Hard Sci-Fi:** *The Martian* by Andy Weir (A gripping story of survival on Mars)\n*   **Military Sci-Fi:** *The Company of the Star-Crowned* by Richard K.

The song is about a man who is in love with a woman who is not as happy as he is. He is patient and understanding, but he can't help but feel a little sad that she's not as happy as he is. The lyrics are filled with imagery of horses and the countryside, which add to the song's romantic and slightly lonely feel. The music is simple and understated, with a focus on the interplay between the piano and Rob Thomas's voice."}, {"instruction": "I'd like you to write me a story in the style of Don Delillo, about a bunch of immortal cats living in a New York high-rise co-op.

It sounded like a thousand tiny fingernails scraping against glass. I watched it fall, the way it always did, and thought about the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light that pierced the gloom. They were the same dust motes, you see. They were everywhere.\r\nI was sitting on the edge of the bed, which was a massive, uncomfortable thing covered in a thick, synthetic fur, and watching the rain. I was waiting for a message. A message from the other side.\r\nThere were six of us here, all of us immortal cats. We called ourselves the Collective. We\u2019d become a thing in the late 19th century, a strange, almost anthropological phenomenon. We\u2019d simply\u2026merged. We were all cats, but we were also cats who had been around for an age.\r\nThere was Jasper, the ginger one, who always seemed to be pacing. He was the most restless of us. Then there was Luna, the black one, who was always curled up asleep.\r\nAnd then there was Silas, the skinny one, who spent most of his time staring out the window.\r\nAnd then there was Myrtle, the white one, who was always grooming herself.\r\nAnd then there was Finn, the big one, who was the most pragmatic of us all. He was the one who kept the building running.\r\nWe were waiting for a message from the other side. It was a simple thing, really. A single word. A single color.\r\nWe\u2019d all been expecting it for a long time. The other side was a place of pure sensation. A place of pure color. A place of pure, unadulterated noise.\r\nWe\u2019d all been waiting for the color red.\r\nAnd now, the rain was falling, and the color red was falling on the windowpane, and we all waited.\r\nI felt a strange twitch in my tail. It was the same sensation I felt when I was thinking about the color red. It was a dull, throbbing pressure behind my eyes.\r\nI looked at Jasper, who was still pacing. He stopped, turned, and stared at me. He blinked slowly. Then he yawned. A long, slow, languished yawn.\r\nI felt a sudden, overwhelming urge to lick my paw. I licked my paw. Then I licked again. And again. And again.\r\nIt was a strange, almost hypnotic quality to it. It was like the rain was falling in slow motion, and I was falling in slow motion.\r\nI felt the sensation of the rain, and I felt the sensation of the rain.\r\nI felt the sensation of the rain.\r\nI felt the sensation of the rain.\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nOf\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nOf\r\nI\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\r\nOf\rof\rand\r\nOf\rof\rof\rand\rof\rof\rof\rOf\rof\rof\rand\rOf\rOf\rOf\rof\r\nOf\rOf\rof\r\nOf\rOf\rOf\rof\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\r\nOf\rof\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rand\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rof\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rof\rOf\rof\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOf\rOf\rOf\rOfOfOfOf\rOf\rOf\rof\rOf\rof\rof\rOfOfOf\rOf\rof\rOfOfOf\rof\rof\rOfOfOfOfOf\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rOfOfOfOf\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rofOf\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\randof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\randof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rof\rofof\randof\randof\randof\randof\randof\rof\rof\rof\rand\rand\rand\randof\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand\r\r\rand\rand\r\r\r\rand\rand\rand\rand\rand

that the native Australians were prisoners of England is a complex and controversial one, and it's been the subject of much debate and research in recent years. While the term \"prisoner\" is often used, it's important to understand that the relationship between the two groups was far more nuanced and less of a simple exchange of captors and captives.\r\n\r\nThe story of the \"White Australia\" policy, which was implemented in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is central to this debate. This policy aimed to prevent the spread of disease and the introduction of foreign ideas, and it led to the isolation of remote areas of Australia, including the Outback.\r\n\r\nEarly anthropologists, such as Sir Harry Perkins and Charles Perkins, began to question the traditional view of the relationship between Aboriginal Australians and Europeans. They argued that the Aboriginal people had always been living in Australia, and that the \"White Australia\" policy was a way of suppressing their culture and way of life.\r\n\r\nMore recent research, including genetic studies and anthropological fieldwork, has provided a more complex picture. Genetic studies have shown that Aboriginal Australians are not as closely related to the mainland populations as previously thought, and that they have a much more diverse genetic makeup.\r\n\r\nAnthropological fieldwork has revealed that the Aboriginal people of the Outback had a rich and complex culture, with a strong oral tradition, sophisticated knowledge of the land, and a deep connection to the spiritual world. They were skilled hunters, gatherers, and builders, and they had a complex social structure based on kinship and clan.\r\n\r\nIt's now widely accepted that the relationship between Aboriginal Australians and Europeans was a result of colonization, not a simple exchange of captors and captives. The Aboriginal people were not prisoners of England; they were victims of colonization, who were forced to cede their land and their culture to the Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe term \"White Australia\" was a deliberate attempt to erase Aboriginal identity and culture, and it was used to justify the dispossession of Aboriginal people from their lands and their way of life.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that Aboriginal Australians are the original inhabitants of Australia, and their culture and heritage are an integral part of the country's identity.\r\n\r\nThe debate over the relationship between Aboriginal Australians and Europeans is ongoing, and it's important to approach it with sensitivity and respect for Aboriginal culture and history.\r\n\r\n#### Note: This response is a simplified overview of a complex issue and does not represent a definitive account of the history of Aboriginal Australians."}, {"instruction": "What color is the sky", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The sky is blue.\n"}, {"instruction": "Is there a meaning for Christmas wreaths?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Christmas wreaths have a long and varied history, and their meaning has evolved over time.

Any suggestions on how to do that?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Okay, this is a really common problem and there are several ways to tackle it. Here's a breakdown of strategies, from least to most intrusive:\n\n1. **Make your garden less appealing to the cat:**\n   * **Scent deterrents:** Cats are very sensitive to smells. You can try placing these around your garden:\n      *   Citrus peels (orange, lemon, grapefruit)\n      *   Peppermint oil (diluted in water in a spray bottle)\n      *   Vinegar\n      *   Coffee grounds\n      *   Cayenne pepper (use with caution, as it can irritate eyes)\n   * **Texture deterrents:** Cats don\u2019t like to walk on certain surfaces.\n      *   Aluminum foil\n      *   Plastic or metal garden furniture\n      *   Spiky plants (like cacti)\n      *   Rough gravel or stones\n\n\n2. **Physical Barriers:**\n   * **Cat-proof fence:** A solid fence (wood, metal, or vinyl) is the most effective way to keep your cat in and your cat out. Make sure it's at least 6 feet high and buried a few inches into the ground to prevent digging.\n   * **Netting:** A fine-mesh netting can be placed over your garden to prevent climbing.\n   * **Slatted fence:** A fence with slatted wood or metal can be less intimidating to cats than a solid fence.\n\n\n3. **Motion-Activated Sprays:** These are a great option because they don\u2019t have to be watched. When the cat approaches, the spray is activated, startling it and deterring it from coming back. Be sure to position them so they don\u2019t spray your garden.\n\n\n4. **Ultrasonic Repellers:** These devices emit high-frequency sounds that are supposed to be unpleasant to cats. Effectiveness varies, and some cats are less bothered than others.\n\n\n5. **Neener-Neener No-Chase Spray:** This spray is designed to make the cat feel bad when it walks across it. It\u2019s not a permanent solution, but it can help keep the cat away for a while.\n\n\n6. **Never use methods that could harm your cat:** This includes using loud noises, sudden movements, or any method that could scare or injure your cat.\n\n\n7. **Talk to your neighbour:** This is the most important step. Explain the situation to your neighbour and see if you can come to a mutually agreeable solution.

These are removed through a process called \u201csweetening\u201d to make it suitable for use in cars.\n6. **Refining:** The gasoline then goes through further refining steps to remove any remaining impurities and meet quality standards.\n#### 1000"}, {"instruction": "Can you give any tips on how to cook a juicy, medium-rare steak?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "- Use a meat thermometer: The most accurate way to determine doneness is with a instant-read thermometer.

In 1973, DJ Kool Herc is credited with inventing the breakbeat, a form of music that emphasized the instrumental break between songs. This technique, combined with the use of two turntables, allowed for extended instrumental sections, which became a core element of hip hop. In 1975, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five recorded \"The Message,\" which helped to popularize the style. In 1976, Afrika Bambaataa coined the term \"hip hop\" and founded the Zulu Nation, a community that promoted positive values and artistic expression. In 1980, Run-DMC released \"Raising Hell,\" which helped to solidify hip hop as a distinct genre.

eyes on a hen,\r\nOr two ears on a man,\r\nOr two tails on a pig.\r\n\r\nAnd Albert, he thought, \"That's it!\"\r\n\"That's the secret of the atom, I see!\"\r\nHe ran to his lab and started to build,\r\nA little chain reaction, just for him.\r\nHe took some uranium, some polonium,\r\nAnd some thorium, and some radium too,\r\nAnd he started to add them all together,\r\nLike adding spices to a stew,\r\nAnd he kept adding them, and adding them more,\r\nTill his lab started to glow, and glow, and glow.\r\n\r\nAnd then he shouted, \"I have done it!\"\r\n\"I have made a chain reaction, you see!\"\r\nAnd the whole world cheered, \"Hooray for Albert!\"\r\nBut Albert just smiled and went to sleep,\r\nAnd dreamt of little suns and planets kind,\r\nDreaming of atoms, and their strange

I felt a strange pulling, a stretching, like my bones were being rearranged, and the world swam before my eyes. When the dizziness subsided, I looked down and nearly fainted. My hands were no longer covered in the coarse wool of my tunic, but were covered in the thick, flowing hair of a great beast. My belt pouch had become a massive shield, and my belt buckle was a great, gnarled staff. I was Gandalf the Grey. \r\n \r\nThe Warrior of Light, a man of such stoic grace as to be almost frightening, approached me, his face an unreadable mask. Nashu, a woman of piercing blue eyes and an even more piercing gaze, followed close behind.\r\n\"You are not yourself, Gandalf,\" said Nashu, her voice like the crackling of a dying fire. \"You are not yourself, and you must return.\"\r\n\"But I am Gandalf!\" I protested, my voice a low growl. \"I am supposed to be a wizard, a hero!\"\r\n\"You are a man of many faces,\" said the Warrior of Light, his voice flat and devoid of emotion. \"A man of many faces, but not one of true goodness.\"\r\nThe journey to the Grey Havens was long and arduous. We traveled through a land of perpetual twilight, where the trees wept tears of silver and the air hung heavy with the smell of wet stone and pine. We battled grotesque imps and outwore a pack of wolves whose teeth were made of pure shadow.\r\n \r\nFinally, we arrived at the Grey Havens, a place of hushed reverence and somber beauty. The walls were made of the same grey stone as the stones of my chamber, and the tapestries depicted scenes of heroic battles and tragic defeats.\r\nThe Grey Havens were a place of strange and subtle magic, and it was here that Gandalf, in his true form, taught me the ways of the world. He showed me how to use my mind to shape the very elements, how to speak with animals, and how to see through illusions.\r\n \r\nBut the change had taken root, and the pull to return to my old self was growing stronger. The Warrior of Light and Nashu, sensing my struggle, joined us, their combined power a balm to my troubled spirit.\r\nWe spent days in meditation, meditating on the nature of good and evil, on the balance between light and shadow, and on the importance of honor.\r\n \r\nFinally, the change began to reverse. The strange, grey, and I felt the strange, and I felt the strange.

You're aiming for a balance between solid preparation and exploring new interests. Here are some ideas, broken down by category:\n\n**1. Strengthening Your Bioengineering Foundation (If you haven't already):**\n\n*   **Advanced Courses:** If you haven't taken them, consider taking more advanced courses in areas like:\n    *   Machine Learning\n    *   Deep Learning\n    *   Reinforcement Learning\n    *   Neural Architectures\n    *   Signal Processing\n    *   Biomedical Imaging\n*   **Research Lab Work:** If you haven't already, start working in a lab. This is *crucial*. Even if it's just assisting with data collection or basic experiments, it will give you experience and connections.\n*   **Specialized Software:** Become proficient in any software packages that are commonly used in neuroscience research (e.g., MATLAB, Python, R, LabVIEW).\n\n**2. Exploring Neuroscience-Related Fields (To help you narrow down your research interests):**\n\n*   **Cognitive Neuroscience:** If you're particularly interested in how the brain *processes* information, this is a great area.\n*   **Neuroimaging:** If you're fascinated by how the brain *creates* images, this could be a good fit.\n*   **Behavioral Neuroscience:** If you're interested in how the brain *responds* to stimuli, this could be a good fit.\n*   **Computational Neuroscience:** You're already in this field, but think about specific problems you'd like to tackle. (e.g., modeling neural circuits, developing new algorithms for brain stimulation, analyzing large-scale brain data).\n*   **Biomedical Engineering:** If you're interested in the application of engineering principles to biological systems, this could be a good fit. (e.g., developing new brain implants, creating brain-computer interfaces, designing prosthetics that integrate with the nervous system).\n*   **Systems Biology:** If you're interested in understanding how the brain *functions as a whole* rather than just the individual parts, this could be a good fit.\n\n\n**3.  Gain Practical Skills (To make you a more competitive applicant):**\n\n*   **Data Analysis:** Become very comfortable with data analysis. You'll need to be able to read, interpret, and present your findings.\n*   **Statistical Analysis:** This is a must.\n*   **Programming:** Learn Python. This is a must.\n*   Data analysis\n*   and\n*\n*"}, {"instruction": "Write an interview between a Female Film director and a journalist.

I\u2019ve been looking into it, and it\u2019s estimated that there are less than 10% of all film directors who are female. That means, if you\u2019re a female director, you\u2019re fighting an uphill battle every single day.\r\n**Interviewer:** That\u2019s a truly disheartening statistic. And it\u2019s not just the number of directors; it\u2019s the lack of opportunities. How do you feel about the lack of female representation in the film industry?\r\n**Anya Sharma:** It\u2019s a systemic issue, and it\u2019s deeply frustrating. We\u2019re told that women are just as capable as men, but we don\u2019t see it reflected in the roles we\u2019re given, the money we\u2019re given, or the recognition we get. It\u2019s not enough.\r\n**Interviewer:** You\u2019ve been very vocal about the need for greater female rights. What are some of the most pressing issues facing female filmmakers today?\r\n**Anya Sharma:** The pay gap is huge. Female directors are consistently paid less than their male counterparts for the same work. There\u2019s also the issue of lack of access to funding. It\u2019s so difficult to get a film made, especially if you\u2019re female, that you\u2019re often forced to take on investors who don\u2019t share your vision. And then there\u2019s the problem of the \u201cbrothel\u201d industry, where female filmmakers are often shut out of the process before they even have a chance to be heard.\r\n**Interviewer:** You\u2019ve been praised for your use of sound and your ability to create a sense of atmosphere. How do you approach these elements in your films?\r\n**Anya Sharma:** I think sound and atmosphere are the most important tools for a film. They can create a world, a feeling, a mood. I want to use them to tell a story. I want to make a story. I want to tell a story.\r\n**I want to tell a story.** I want to tell a story.\r\n**I want to tell a story.\r\nAnya\r\n**\r\n"}, {"instruction": "Give me a sample 5 day itienary for a switzerland holiday, starting from Basel", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "- 1 day: Lucerne - Explore the city and its lake.\n - 2 days: Swiss Alps - Hike to a mountain or take a cable car.\n - 3 days: Zurich - Visit the city center and the lake.\n - 4 days: Bern - Visit the city center and the lake.\n - 5 days: Basel - Explore the city and its lake."}, {"instruction": "explain The Death of Ivan Ilych", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The Death of Ivan Ilych by Viktor Shklovsky is a novella that explores the themes of death, art, and the meaning of life. It is a story about a young artist named Dushkin, who is invited to paint a portrait of Ivan Ilych, a famous and respected but deeply unhappy man. As Dushkin tries to capture the essence of Ilych, he becomes increasingly obsessed with the subject and loses his own sense of self. The story is told in the first person by Dushkin, and it is a stream of consciousness narrative that gradually reveals the full scope of his obsession.\r\nThe novella is divided into three parts, each of about 20 pages. The first part is a series of sketches and notes that Dushkin makes as he tries to paint Ilych. The second part is a more detailed account of Dushkin's obsession, as he becomes increasingly disturbed by the process. The third part is a final, fragmented account of Dushkin's experience, which is filled with images and sensations that suggest the meaning of the story.\r\nThe story is told in a detached, almost clinical manner, which makes it difficult to read. The language is spare and precise, and the characters are largely absent. The only characters in the story are Dushkin and Ivan Ilych, and their relationship is one of mutual disdain and resentment.\r\nThe story is a meditation on the nature of art and the meaning of life. It suggests that art can be a way of escaping the truth of life, and that the pursuit of beauty can be a form of self-deception. It also suggests that the only thing that truly matters is the quality of one's own life, and that art can be a way of finding meaning in the face of death.\r\nThe story is a complex and challenging work, but it is also a deeply rewarding one. It is a story that stays with you long after you have finished reading it, and it forces you to confront the uncomfortable truths about yourself and the world around you.\r\n\r\nThe novella is divided into three parts, each of about 20 pages.

However, these metrics don't always correlate well with human perception, which can lead to an overestimation of performance.  Here's how to improve AP metrics with human knowledge:\n\n1. **Use a combination of metrics:** Don't rely solely on the number of instances or overlap. Combine metrics like:\n   - Number of instances per class:  A higher number might indicate more instances but could also mean less precise segmentation.\n   - IoU (Intersection over Union): A better measure of overlap than simple overlap, especially for objects with irregular shapes.\n   - Dice Coefficient: Similar to IoU, but more robust to class imbalance.\n   - mIoU: A weighted average of the IoU and Dice coefficients.\n   - Human-in-the-loop evaluation: Involve human annotators to rate the quality of the segmentation, providing a ground truth for comparison.\n\n2. **Incorporate human-understandable concepts:**  Use human-centric metrics that reflect how humans perceive objects:\n   - Shape:  Segmentations that closely match human-defined shapes are preferred.\n   - Texture:  Segmentations with realistic textures are better.\n   - Color:  Segmentations with consistent color are preferred.\n   - Spatial relationships:  Segmentations that maintain consistent spatial relationships between objects are better.\n   - Object identity:  Segmentations that accurately identify the same object across different viewpoints or lighting conditions are better.\n\n3. **Use a human-guided evaluation protocol:** Develop a protocol that guides human annotators through the evaluation process, ensuring consistency and reducing subjectivity. This could include:\n   - Clear guidelines: Provide annotators with detailed instructions on how to segment objects.\n   - Multiple annotations: Have multiple annotators segment the same images and use their annotations to create a consensus.\n   - Qualitative feedback:  Ask annotators to provide qualitative feedback on the quality of the segmentations, explaining their reasoning.\n\n4. **Fine-tune the model based on human feedback:** Use the human annotations to fine-tune the model and improve its performance. This could involve adjusting the model's parameters or retraining it on a dataset with more human-annotated data.\n\n5. **Consider using a human-in-the-loop approach:** Involve human experts in the entire pipeline, from data collection to evaluation.

It's not simply about holding contradictory views, but about a fundamental disconnect between the core principles of an ideology and how adherents actually behave in the real world. This disconnect fuels a sense of moral wrongness, a drive to correct the inconsistency, and ultimately, a re-evaluation of the ideology itself.\r\nHere's a breakdown of the relationship:\r\n*   **Core Beliefs as a Framework:** Ideologies provide a framework for understanding the world, defining values, and establishing goals. They offer a map for navigating life.\r\n*   **Behavioral Inconsistency:** When an individual's actions contradict their beliefs, it creates a tension. This tension is often experienced as a moral crisis, a sense of being a \"bad person\" because one's actions don't align with what one believes to be right.\r\n*   **The Drive to Rectify:** The inconsistency motivates a desire to change one's beliefs to match one's actions. This isn't always a rational process; it can be driven by emotional factors, a need for self-justification, or a desire to maintain a positive self-image.\r\n*   **Re-evaluation and Transformation:** The process of reconciling inconsistency can lead to a re-evaluation of the ideology itself. It might involve modifying the beliefs, adopting new practices, or even abandoning the ideology altogether.\r\n*   **Cycle of Inconsistency:** The cycle can repeat itself, with new inconsistencies arising as the individual's life experiences and changing circumstances influence their beliefs.\r\n*   **Not Always Rational:** It's important to note that the drive to rectify inconsistency isn't always rational. It can be a sign of underlying psychological distress or a failure to adequately process difficult experiences.\r\n*   **Spectrum of Inconsistency:** Inconsistency isn't an all-or-nothing phenomenon. There can be varying degrees of inconsistency, ranging from mild disagreements to radical contradictions.\r\n*   **Social and Cultural Factors:** The intensity and nature of the inconsistency are often influenced by social and cultural factors, as well as the individual's personality and history.\r\n*   **Role of Authority:** In some cases, ideological inconsistency can be exacerbated by the authority of the ideology itself, which may be seen as unyielding or out of touch with reality.\r\n*   **Beyond Simple Disagreement:** It's important to distinguish between simple disagreement and ideological inconsistency. Simple disagreement is a normal part of intellectual debate, while ideological inconsistency represents a more fundamental break in one's worldview.\r\n*   **Psychological Roots:** Inconsistency is often linked to issues of self-esteem, identity, and the need for coherence.\r\n*   **Not always a problem:** Inconsistency is not always a problem. Some people can be consistent in their beliefs and act in ways that are consistent."}, {"instruction": "Why do people give Reddit Gold to admins?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Reddit Gold is given to admins to help them run their subreddit.

Instead, they should focus on understanding and managing risk, and be prepared for the possibility of unexpected events.\r\nHe also warns against the dangers of overconfidence in markets, arguing that it is easy to believe that one can consistently beat the market, but this is rarely the case.\r\nIn essence, Taleb challenges the notion that markets are rational and efficient, arguing that they are, in fact, highly unpredictable and prone to errors."}, {"instruction": "Can a boy and girl be just be best friends only ever\n", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Yes, a boy and girl can be just be best friends only ever.

When I was a child, my mother would lure me out to the sea in a small boat, whispering songs of the deep and the creatures that dwell within. I would spend hours watching the waves, trying to catch her attention, but she would always slip away, dissolving back into the foam.\r\nOne day, a storm of such fury I had never seen before erupted from the Grey Sea. The wind howled like a banshee, and the rain lashed against the boat with a force that threatened to tear it apart. Just as I feared the worst, a figure leaped from the waves, a woman with the body of a woman and the face of a seal. She was beautiful and terrifying in equal measure.\r\nShe called to me, her voice a chorus of crashing waves and mournful cries, and I, driven by a strange compulsion, followed her into the storm. As we drew closer, I saw that she was mourning. Her eyes were red and swollen, and her mouth was swollen with tears. She was mourning the loss of her lover, a young sailor who had gone out to sea on a long voyage.\r\nAs she wept, her body began to change. Her skin became smooth and pale, her hair turned silver, and her teeth sharpened into fangs. When she finished crying, she was no longer a woman, but a seal. A beautiful, mournful seal.\r\nShe turned to me, her eyes burning with an ancient sadness, and in a voice that sounded like the cry of the wind, said, \"You have been chosen. You will walk the sea with me, and you will help me to find my lost love.\"\r\nI, of course, didn\u2019t understand her words, but I knew that she was asking me to join her on a quest.

Today, I want to talk to you about the incredible power of innovation and how it\u2019s shaping our economy for the better. Innovation isn\u2019t just about new gadgets or fancy software; it\u2019s about fundamentally changing how we do things, and it\u2019s delivering some truly game-changing benefits for Australia. \r\n \r\nSo, what are the top five benefits of innovation that we\u2019re seeing right now? \r\n \n1.  **Boosting Productivity:** Innovation is the engine of productivity growth. It means our businesses are becoming more efficient, using fewer resources, and producing more goods and services with the same amount of effort. \r\n2.  **Creating Jobs:** New industries and new ways of working are always being born from innovation, and these new jobs are often high-value, well-paying jobs. \r\n3.  **Increasing Exports:** Innovation allows us to produce goods and services that are more competitive in the global market, leading to increased exports and higher incomes. \r\n4.  **Improving the Standard of Living:** Ultimately, innovation helps us all have a better standard of living by increasing our incomes, improving our health, and enhancing our quality of life. \r\n5.  **Strengthening our Resilience:** Innovation helps us to adapt to changing circumstances, whether it\u2019s climate change, pandemics, or global economic shocks. \r\n \r\nAustralia has a strong foundation for innovation, with a vibrant research sector, a skilled workforce, and a supportive business environment. But we need to continue to invest in these areas to ensure that Australia remains at the forefront of the global innovation economy. \r\n \r\nWe will continue to do just that, by increasing our R&D spending, supporting our universities and research institutions, and creating a more conducive environment for startups and small businesses. \r\n \r\nLet\u2019s work together to build a future where innovation is the key to our economic prosperity. \r\n \r\nThank you."}, {"instruction": "Is online casino legal in India?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Online casino gambling is currently illegal in India.

From a young age, I was captivated by the way light could transform ordinary scenes into something extraordinary. This initial fascination has only grown stronger over time, as I have sought to understand and capture those moments of beauty that seem to pass by so quickly. \r\nMy interest in photography has been further cultivated by studying the work of other photographers, particularly Ansel Adams and Dorothea Lange. Adams' mastery of composition and his ability to evoke emotion through his black and white images have been particularly influential. Lange's dedication to documenting the lives of the working class and her unflinching portrayal of human suffering have taught me the importance of truth and empathy in my own work. \r\nI have always been drawn to the challenge of finding my own unique voice through photography. I enjoy experimenting with different techniques and styles, and I am constantly seeking new ways to express my ideas visually. I believe that photography is not just a skill, but a way of seeing the world, and I am committed to using it to make a positive impact. \r\nUltimately, my passion for photography has not only provided me with a means of artistic expression but has also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the human experience.

These responses include:\r\n- Vasodilation: Blood vessels near the skin's surface dilate, increasing blood flow to the skin.\r\n- Sweating: Your body sweats to cool itself down, which also increases blood flow to the skin.\r\n- Increased metabolic rate: Your body's metabolic rate increases to help generate heat.\r\n- Activation of the sympathetic nervous system: The sympathetic nervous system, which controls the \"fight or flight\" response, is activated, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure.\r\n- Dilation of the pupils: Your pupils dilate to help your eyes adjust to the increased light.\r\nThese physiological responses can make you feel tired and sluggish, which is why being exposed to heat can be draining."}, {"instruction": "write an article informing customer of my saas software that this currently is  beta version of the software and we are working hard to improve and release it to the market.", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "## Our SaaS Software is in Beta - We're Working Hard to Improve It!\r\nWe're excited to announce that our SaaS software is now in beta!

It is based on the principle of discretizing a continuous problem into a series of smaller, simpler problems, which are then assembled to form a global solution. \r\nThe FEM is particularly well-suited for problems with complex geometries, large deformations, and material nonlinearities. \r\nThe process of FEM involves the following steps: \r\n1.  Discretization: The problem domain is divided into a mesh of small elements. \r\n2.  Element Formulation: The governing equations are formulated for each element. \r\n3.  Assembly: The elements are assembled into larger subsystems, and these are assembled into a complete model. \r\n4.  Solution: The solution is obtained by solving the equations in each element. \r\n5.  Post-processing: The results are analyzed and visualized. \r\nThe FEM is a versatile technique and can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including: \r\n*   Structural analysis \r\n*   Heat transfer \r\n*   Fluid flow \r\n*   Electromagnetic field \r\n*   Acoustics \r\n*   Thermoelasticity \r\n*   Biomechanics \r\n*   A variety of other problems \r\nThe FEM is a complex technique, and it requires a good understanding of the underlying theory. However, it is a very effective technique for solving a wide range of engineering problems. \r\n#### 1. Discretization \r\nDiscretization is the process of dividing the problem domain into smaller elements. The most common type of element is the triangle element, which is used for 2D problems. For 3D problems, the tetrahedral element is more commonly used. The elements are typically arranged in a regular grid. \r\n#### 2. Element Formulation \r\nThe governing equations are formulated for each element. These equations are based on the principles of mechanics, heat transfer, or fluid dynamics. \r\n#### 3. Assembly \r\nThe elements are assembled into larger subsystems, and these are assembled into a complete model. \r\n#### 4.

Both cities, despite their geographical distance, offer a unique blend of natural beauty, a laid-back atmosphere, and a distinct cultural flavor. I spent the summer of 2023 in each of these two locations, and while I enjoyed each of them, I found myself drawn to the slower pace and the deep connection to the land in Kanakohe. The sheer scale of the Pacific Ocean and the dramatic, ever-changing landscape of Hawaii, combined with the small, tight-knit community, created an environment that felt both exhilarating and strangely calming.\r\n \nOne of the most striking differences between the two places is the relationship they have with the natural world. In Flagstaff, the landscape is defined by the red rocks and the pine forests that cling to the slopes of the San Francisco Peaks. The air is crisp and clean, and the sounds of the wind through the trees are constant. I spent a lot of time hiking in the area, and I was constantly amazed by the variety of plant and animal life. I remember one afternoon, while I was scrambling over a small rock face near the base of the San Francisco Peaks, I heard the distinct cry of a hawk and saw a flash of blue as a mountain bluebird darted across my path. I felt a sense of awe and humility in the face of such raw power and beauty. The people of Flagstaff are deeply aware of their environment and take great pride in preserving it. They are farmers, ranchers, and outdoor enthusiasts who value sustainability and respect for the land.\r\n \r\nIn contrast, Kanakohe is defined by the ocean. The air is thick with humidity and smells of salt and flowers. The constant sound of the waves crashing against the shore is never-ending. The landscape is a riot of color, with the deep greens of the palms and the brilliant pinks and purples of the hibiscus flowers. I spent a lot of time swimming in the warm Pacific Ocean, and I was constantly amazed by the diversity of marine life. I remember one afternoon, while I was snorkeling in a shallow cove, I saw a sea turtle glide past me, its shell covered in barnacles. I was so startled that I almost fumbled to the side, but then I realized it was a sea turtle.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"}, {"instruction": "ideas for building a waitlist for a new product or service", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "- Build an email list: Collect email addresses from people who are interested in your product or service through your website, social media, or other channels.\n - Create a landing page: Build a landing page that describes your product or service and offers an incentive to sign up for the waitlist.\n - Use a waitlist plugin: Use a waitlist plugin to manage your waitlist and send automated emails to keep people informed about your product or service.\n - Promote your waitlist: Promote your waitlist on social media, in your email newsletters, and on your website.\n - Offer an exclusive discount: Offer an exclusive discount to people who sign up for the waitlist.\n - Be transparent: Be transparent about the fact that your product or service is still in development and that there is no guarantee that it will be launched.\n - Provide regular updates: Keep your waitlist members updated on your progress, even if there are no major updates to share.\n - Thank your waitlist members: Thank your waitlist members for their interest in your product or service.\n - Don\u2019t over-promise: Don\u2019t make any promises about the launch date of your product or service.\n - Be realistic: Be realistic about the time it will take to develop and launch your product or service.\n - Be responsive: Respond to any questions or concerns that your waitlist members may have.\n - Build a community: Build a community around your product or service by encouraging your waitlist members to interact with each other.\n - Use automation: Use automation to send welcome emails, follow-up emails, and other automated messages to your waitlist members.\n - Track your results: Track the results of your waitlist campaign to see what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not.\n - Iterate: Iterate on your waitlist campaign based on the results you see.\n - Be patient: Building a waitlist can take time, so be patient and don\u2019t give up."}, {"instruction": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Okay, let\u2019s talk about reactivity and how to use a pause ritual.

It\u2019s a natural human response to stress, often involving feeling overwhelmed, angry, or shut down. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but when it becomes a pattern, it can sabotage your relationships and your own well-being.\r\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s move on to the pause ritual. It\u2019s a simple way to catch yourself before you react. It\u2019s a 3-second pause, a breath, and a thought. When you feel your anger rising, or your anxiety taking over, take a deep breath in, hold it for a second, and then think, \"I'm feeling this way, and that's okay. I'm going to take a pause.\"\r\n\r\nYou can practice this anywhere, anytime. It doesn\u2019t have to be a fancy thing. It just needs to be a conscious choice to stop and breathe.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to remember that you don\u2019t have to use this ritual every single time you feel the urge to react. It\u2019s a skill, and like any skill, it gets easier with practice.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself. If you miss a day or two, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. Just start again.\r\n\r\nDo you have any questions about this, or would you like to practice the pause ritual with me?"}, {"instruction": "write a 5 verse song in the style of Talking Heads based on the life of a teenager in the 1980s britain", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "(Music starts with a repetitive, slightly off-kilter bassline and a drum machine beat)\n\nThere's a girl, a girl, a girl, a girl,\r\nWho looks like she's seen a ghost,\r\nAnd she's always walking, walking, walking,\r\nAnd she's never coming back to me,\r\nAnd she's always walking, walking, walking,\r\nAnd she's never coming back to me.\r\n\r\nI've got a bike, a bike, a bike, a bike,\r\nAnd I'm going to the arcade to play the games,\r\nAnd I'm going to the cinema to watch the films,\r\nAnd I'm going to the music shop to buy the records,\r\nAnd I'm going to the skate park to ride the roller skates,\r\nAnd I'm going to the beach to play the surfboards.\r\n\r\nThere's a girl, a girl, a girl, a girl,\r\nWho looks like she's seen a ghost,\r\nAnd she's always walking, walking, walking,\r\nAnd she's never coming back to me,\r\nAnd she's always walking, walking, walking,\r\nAnd she's never coming back to me.\r\n\r\nI'm going to the supermarket to buy some milk\r\nAnd some cheese and some bread and some jam,\r\nAnd I'm going to the hairdresser to get my hair cut,\r\nAnd I'm going to the laundrette to wash my clothes,\r\nAnd I'm going to the post office to send some letters,\r\nAnd I'm going to the pub to have a pint of beer.\r\n\r\nThere's a girl, a girl, a girl, a girl,\r\nWho looks like she's seen a ghost,\r\nAnd she's always walking, walking, walking,\r\nAnd she's never coming back to me,\r\nAnd she's always walking, walking, walking,\r\nAnd she's never coming back to me.\r\n\r\n(Music fades out with a final, slightly distorted bassline)"}, {"instruction": "Who will be the president of South Korea in 2023?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The presidential election in South Korea will be held on November 13, 2022.

(e.g., are apartments more or less safe than single-family homes?)\n - How do demographic factors (e.g., income, race, age) interact with housing characteristics to influence crime rates? (e.g., do certain racial groups live in neighborhoods with higher crime rates?)\n - What is the relationship between housing affordability and crime rates? (e.g., are low-income neighborhoods more or less safe?)\n - How does the age of housing affect crime rates? (e.g., are older housing stock areas more or less safe?)\n - Are there any spatial patterns in housing and crime that can be used to predict future crime events? (e.g., can we use GIS to map areas with high crime rates and then look for spatial autocorrelation?)"}, {"instruction": "The sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometres.

Here are a few possibilities for how to approach teaching it:\n*   **Emphasis on the student's experience:** Instead of directly instructing techniques, the teacher would guide the student through self-inquiry to discover their own movements and responses.\n*   **Non-interference:** The teacher would avoid direct interference with the student's experience, allowing the student to learn through their own actions.\n*   **Observation and reflection:** The teacher would encourage the student to observe their own movements and responses, and to reflect on their experiences.\n*   **Integration of movement and awareness:** Aikido movements would be integrated with awareness of the student's body and the surrounding environment.\n*   **Focus on the relationship between student and teacher:** The relationship between the student and the teacher would be seen as a relationship between two selves, rather than a teacher-student one.\n*   **Non-judgmental acceptance:** The teacher would accept the student's experience without judgment, allowing the student to learn from their own mistakes.\n*   **Cultivating a sense of spaciousness:** The teacher would help the student to cultivate a sense of spaciousness in their movements, allowing them to move more easily and with less tension.\n*   **Using the principles of self-awareness:** The teacher would use the principles of self-awareness to help the student to become more aware of their own thoughts and feelings, and to respond to them in a more skillful way.\n*   **Moving beyond the ego:** The teacher would help the student to move beyond the ego and to see themselves as part of a larger whole.\n*   **Acceptance of the natural flow:** The teacher would help the student to accept the natural flow of movement and to let go of their need to control it.\n*   **Non-verbal communication:** Aikido would be taught with a strong emphasis on non-verbal communication, such as posture, balance, and eye contact.\n*   **Emphasize the body as an instrument:** The body would be seen as an instrument for self-expression and for the realization of one's potential.\n*   **Cultivating a sense of presence:** The teacher would help the student to cultivate a sense of presence in their movements, allowing them to be fully present in the moment.\n*   **Non-dualism and the nature of reality:** The teacher would draw on Krishnamurti's philosophy to help the student to see the nature of reality as non-dual, and to understand that the self is not the self.\n*   The student is not a separate from the teacher.\n*"}, {"instruction": "phrase an email to my manager kindly asking for feedback for a dashboard I sent him for his use, and also ask him if I should publish this dashboard to the team, and if there's a certain way he wants me to publish it, or certain orientation to emphasis when publishing", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Subject: Dashboard Feedback & Team Publication\n\nHi [Manager's Name],\n\nI hope you're having a good week.\n\nI've just sent you the dashboard that I prepared for your use.

Include fishermen and a sinister force that drives the inhabitants insane.", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The year is 1888. The wind howls across the desolate, rocky shores of Sylt, a small island off the coast of Germany. A group of weathered fishermen, led by the stoic Captain Klaus, are preparing for their annual catch. But this year, the sea is restless, the sky is bruised and ominous, and a strange, unnatural quiet has fallen over the island.\r\nAs the sun begins to set, casting long, distorted shadows, the men begin to notice the change in their companions. Some become withdrawn, their eyes glazed over, their movements jerky and unnatural. Others, driven mad by an unseen force, begin to scream and thrash against the boat.\r\nCaptain Klaus, ever the pragmatist, tries to maintain order, but even he is not immune to the island's influence. He begins to hear whispers in the wind, see fleeting shadows on the water, and feel an icy hand on his shoulder.\r\nThe true horror of Sylt is not the sea monsters or the ghosts of the dead, but the island itself. It is a living entity, a malevolent spirit that feeds on fear and despair. It drives men to madness, turning them against each other, and slowly, inexorably, it drives the very life out of the island.\r\nAs the night deepens, the fishermen are no longer men, but shells, driven mad by the island's influence. The wind becomes their voice, the waves their rage, and the sea their tomb. And Captain Klaus, the last bastion of reason, is the first to fall, dragged screaming into the icy blackness of the ocean.\r\nThe film ends with a shot of the storm-tossed sea, the skeletal remains of the boats, and the ghostly figure of a fisherman clinging to a piece of driftwood, his eyes wide with terror. The only sound is the relentless cry of the wind.\r\n\r\n**Genre:** Psychological Horror, Island Horror, Gothic Horror\r\n**Themes:** Isolation, Madness, Nature vs. Civilization, The Supernatural, The Power of the Past\r\n**Target Audience:** Adults and mature teens who enjoy slow-burn horror with a focus on atmosphere and psychological dread.\r\n**Unique Selling Point:** The film utilizes the unique and unsettling setting of Sylt, Germany, to create a truly unforgettable and genuinely frightening experience. The island's history and folklore are woven into the narrative, adding another layer of depth and intrigue."}, {"instruction": "I want to open the developler tools in chrome with ctrl + shift + i on this website: https://mnsw.pro/\nIt doesnt work. works on other websites. even here. what is wrong?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The developer tools in Chrome don't work because the website doesn't have proper HTML and CSS.

Kahane would see this as a particularly cynical and opportunistic form of self-interest, used to maintain the power of the establishment and prevent the suffering of the oppressed.\r\n*   **Emphasis on the Marginalized:** Fanon and Zizek both emphasize the importance of the experiences of the marginalized and oppressed. Kahane, like Fanon and Zizek, would see the American Jewish Establishment as particularly responsible for the suffering of the Black community, because it has historically denied them the opportunity to achieve true equality.\r\n*   **Rejection of Assimilation:** Fanon and Zizek both critique the American Jewish Establishment's belief in assimilation. Kahane would see this as a particularly dangerous form of assimilation, because it would allow the Black community to lose its unique identity and become indistinguishable from the white establishment.\r\n*   **Use of the Holocaust:** Fanon and Zizek both use the Holocaust as a means to expose the hypocrisy of the establishment.

These events are already causing significant loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and economic disruption.\r\nThe longer we delay in taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the more severe these impacts will be and the more difficult it will be to adapt to the changes that are already underway.\r\nTo stop climate change, we need to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This means transitioning to a low-carbon economy based on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. It also means improving energy efficiency, reducing deforestation, and adopting sustainable land management practices.\r\nBeyond emissions reductions, we also need to adapt to the changes that are already underway. This means building more resilient infrastructure, developing drought-resistant crops, and managing water resources more effectively.\r\nThe window of opportunity to secure a liveable future for all is rapidly closing. We must act now with courage and determination to reduce emissions and adapt to the changes that are already underway.\r\n#### 1.1 Mitigation: Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions\r\n#### 1.1.1. Transition to Renewable Energy: Investing in and deploying renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower is crucial.\r\n#### 1.1.2. Energy Efficiency: Improving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry can significantly reduce emissions.\r\n#### 1.1.3. Sustainable Transportation: Promoting electric vehicles, public transportation, cycling, and walking can reduce emissions from the transportation sector.\r\n#### 1.1.4. Carbon Capture and Storage: Developing and deploying carbon capture and storage technologies can help reduce emissions from industrial processes.\r\n#### 1.1.5. Reforestation and Afforestation: Planting trees can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\r\n#### 1.1.6. Sustainable Agriculture: Adopting sustainable agricultural practices can reduce emissions from the agricultural sector and enhance carbon sequestration in soils.\r\n#### 1.1.7. Policy and Regulation: Governments can play a key role by implementing policies and regulations that incentivize emissions reductions and promote sustainable practices.\r\n#### 1.1.8. International Cooperation: Climate change is a global problem that requires international cooperation. Countries must work together to reduce emissions and adapt to the changes that are already underway."}, {"instruction": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "It's a combination of factors, but here are the main reasons why it feels easier to watch a series of TV episodes than a single movie:\n*   **Serialisation:** TV shows are designed to be watched in installments, with each episode building upon the previous one. This creates a sense of continuity and allows you to gradually get into the characters and world, making it easier to tune in and out.\n*   **Familiarity:** You've already seen most of the episodes, so you don't need to pay as much attention to new details or catch up on anything.\n*   **Predictability:** TV shows often have a clear beginning, middle, and end, which can make it easier to follow the plot and know what's going to happen next.\n*   **Less Cognitive Load:** Movies require more active attention and mental processing because you're trying to remember everything that's happening. TV shows, on the other hand, are more passive and allow you to let your mind wander.\n*   **Reward System:** TV shows often have cliffhangers and unresolved plot threads, which can keep you coming back for more. Movies, with their linear narrative, don't offer this kind of reward."}, {"instruction": "how do I appear in a video call as if I'd be actively listening while I am actually sleeping?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "This is a very common request, and there are several ways to make it look like you're listening while you're actually asleep. Here are a few of the most popular methods:\n\n*   **The \"Quiet Nod\" Technique:** This is probably the most well-known method. Before the call, you'll need to find a way to mute your microphone. Then, when the meeting starts, you'll type a short, almost silent \"nods\" into the chat window. The meeting platform will record your typing, and it will appear as if you were actively listening.\n*   **The \"Head-Nod\" Technique:** This is a slightly more subtle method. When the meeting starts, you'll type a short, almost silent \"head-nod\" into the chat window. Again, the meeting platform will record your typing, and it will appear as if you were actively listening.\n*   **The \"Eye-Nod\" Technique:** This is a more advanced technique. When the meeting starts, you'll type a short, almost silent \"eye-nod\" into the chat window. The meeting platform will record your typing, and it will appear as if you were actively listening.\n*   **Using a Virtual Background:** Some video conferencing platforms allow you to use a virtual background. You could use a neutral-looking background, such as a plain wall or a simple bookshelf, and then type your responses into the chat window. The meeting platform will record your typing, and it will appear as if you were actively listening.\n\n**Important Note:** While these techniques can make it look like you're listening, they don't actually make you listen. The meeting platform will record your typing, and it will appear as if you were actively listening. This means that if you're actually asleep, the meeting platform will record your typing, and it will appear as if you were listening, even though you weren't.\n\nTo make this look even more convincing, you can also use a third-party tool to record your audio. There are many such tools available, such as:\n*   OBS Studio (free and open-source)\n*   Dragon One (paid)\n*   Screencastify (paid)"}, {"instruction": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The temperature of a metal is directly proportional to the rate at which it emits light.

It occurs when we use past experience to infer that something will continue to happen in the future. We can never be certain about the future, and therefore, we can never be certain about the truth of past experience.\r\n*   **Confirmation Bias:** We tend to seek out and interpret information in a way that confirms our existing beliefs. This can lead us to overestimate the likelihood of things that are already true and underestimate the likelihood of things that are false.\r\n*   **The Problem of Induction:** This is a philosophical problem that asks how we can justify the use of inductive reasoning (reasoning from specific observations to general conclusions). It is a difficult problem to solve, and there is no universally accepted solution.\r\n*   **Skepticism:** A skeptical approach involves questioning all claims, including those that are widely accepted. It is important to be skeptical, but it is also important to be open-minded.\r\n*   **Critical Thinking:** Critical thinking involves analyzing information objectively, identifying assumptions, evaluating evidence, and drawing conclusions based on reason. It is the best way to deal with claims that are not supported by evidence.\r\n*   **The Limits of Human Knowledge:** It is important to remember that our knowledge of the world is always incomplete. There will always be things that we don't know, and that we can't know.\r\n*   **The Role of Narrative:** Our beliefs are often shaped by the stories we tell ourselves and others about the world. These stories can be powerful, but they can also be misleading.\r\n*   **The Importance of Evidence:** While it is rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence, it is also important to be skeptical of claims that are not supported by evidence.\r\n*   **The Value of Reason:** Reason is a valuable tool for understanding the world, but it is not infallible. It can be wrong, and it can be misled.\r\n*   **The Danger of Dogmatism:** Dogmatism is the belief that one's own beliefs are self-evident and cannot be doubted. It is dangerous because it can lead to intolerance and resistance to new ideas.\r\n*   **The Importance of Dialogue:** Dialogue is the process of exchanging ideas and arguments. It is important to engage in dialogue with people who hold different beliefs, but it is also important to be willing to listen to and learn from others.\r\n*   **The Role of Emotion:** Emotions can influence our beliefs, but they do not determine them.\r\n*   **The Importance of Self-reflection:** Self-reflection is important, but it is not infallible.\r\n"}, {"instruction": "Give me the list of top 100 tech categories", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "1.

It's a centuries-old myth, and it's been around since the 16th century. The story goes that in the 16th century, a man named John Henry was arrested for stealing a large amount of spaghetti from a church. He was condemned to hang but was released on bail and told he could buy his freedom with a single, perfect sprig of spaghetti. He went to the market and bought a sprig, but when he went to cook it, it turned into a giant, woody stalk. He then went to the butcher and bought a whole sprig, which grew into a tree. The butcher, thinking he was being funny, sold the tree to a village elder, who then sold it to a traveling salesman, who sold it to a wealthy landowner, and so on, until the spaghetti was completely consumed. The landowner, thinking he was being clever, then sold the spaghetti to a chef, who then made a sauce and served it to his guests. The guests, thinking they were eating spaghetti, ate the sauce and then started to fall asleep. The chef, realizing the mistake, stopped serving the sauce and told his guests to go to bed. The guests, now asleep, went to sleep themselves, and the spaghetti withered on the tree.\r\nThe story was repeated and embellished over the years, and it eventually became a popular myth in Britain.\r\nThe deception was used by the storytellers to make people believe that spaghetti was a dangerous plant that could kill you if you ate it. The storytellers would claim that the spaghetti was growing on trees because it was poisonous and that people should avoid it at all costs. The story was used to justify the persecution of people who ate spaghetti, as they were seen as dangerous because they were eating the poisonous plant.\r\nThe story of spaghetti trees is a great example of how myths can be used to justify discrimination and persecution.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of how it works and its applications:\n\n**How Stable Diffusion Enhances Low-Resolution/Low-Quality Images:**\n\n1. **Denoising and Super-Resolution:** At its core, Stable Diffusion uses a process called \"denoising\" to add fine details to a low-resolution image. It does this by learning to reverse the noise that\u2019s inherent in the low-resolution data.\n2. **Latent Diffusion:** A key innovation is \"latent diffusion.\" Instead of directly working on the high-resolution image, Stable Diffusion operates in a lower-dimensional \"latent space.\" This means it doesn\u2019t need to deal with all the raw pixel data, making it much faster and less memory-intensive.\n3. **Text-Guided Refinement:** The algorithm is guided by text prompts. You can tell it to \"add more detail,\" \"sharpen the image,\" or \"improve the lighting,\" and it will use its learned knowledge to enhance the low-resolution image accordingly.\n4. **Progressive Refinement:** The process is iterative. You can give Stable Diffusion a starting point (a low-resolution image) and then refine it through multiple steps, each adding more detail and correcting any artifacts.\n\n\n**Potential Advantages and Limitations:**\n\n* **Upscaling:** Stable Diffusion can dramatically increase the resolution of low-quality images, from 1080p to 4K or even higher.\n* **Efficient Compression:** The process is less computationally expensive than directly upscaling to high resolutions, which means it can be used to compress images without significant loss of quality.\n* **CGI and Digital Art:** It\u2019s a game-changer for creating photorealistic CGI assets and digital art. You can generate incredibly detailed textures, environments, and characters from low-resolution input.\n* **Limitations:**\n    * **Prompt Engineering:** The quality of the upscaled image heavily depends on the quality of the input. You need to write good prompts to guide Stable Diffusion.\n    * **Artifacts:** It can still sometimes produce artifacts, especially in areas with fine details or complex lighting.\n    * **Style Consistency:** Maintaining a consistent style across multiple upscaled versions can be challenging.\n    * **Copyright:** Using AI-generated images raises copyright questions, depending on the training data and usage rights.\n\n\n**Beyond Upscaling: Creative Applications**\n\n* **Image Editing:** You can use it to fix imperfections in your images.\n* **Texture Generation:** It can generate new textures.\n* **Style Transfer:** It can be used to transfer the style of a particular artist.\n* **Image Generation:** It can be used to generate new images in a new style."}, {"instruction": "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "According to the classic children's book \"The Wind in the Willows,\" an unladen swallow can fly at a speed of 60 miles per hour.\nIf you add the speed of an eagle, which is 110 mph, the total airspeed velocity of a swallow becomes 60+110=<<60+110=170>>170 mph.\n#### 170"}, {"instruction": "How can I use software defined radio to detect and locate a drone flying over my property?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a great option for this because it can be used to listen to a wide range of frequencies and can be easily adapted to a specific purpose. Here's a breakdown of how you can use SDR to detect and locate a drone:\n\n1.  **Choose an SDR Platform:**\n    *   **GNU Radio:** A free and open-source SDR toolkit. It's powerful but has a steeper learning curve.\n    *   **Airspy:** A popular SDR platform known for its high-quality reception and low latency. It's a commercial product but has a free trial.\n    *   **RTL-SDR:** A free and open-source SDR platform that uses the RTL-SDR chip. It's a good option if you're on a budget.\n    *   **LimeSDR:** A free and open-source SDR platform that uses the LimeSDR chip. It's a good option if you're on a budget.\n\n\n2.  **Acquire a Drone-Specific Frequency:**\n    *   Drones often use specific frequencies to communicate with each other or with ground stations. You'll need to research which frequencies are commonly used by drones in your area.\n    *   Some common frequencies include 915 MHz, 433 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.8 GHz.\n    *   You can use a frequency scanner app on your smartphone to help you find these frequencies.\n\n\n3.  **Set up an SDR Receiver:**\n    *   Connect your SDR receiver to your computer via USB.\n    *   Configure the SDR software to receive the frequency you've identified.\n    *   Set up an SDR receiver that can be used in a loopback mode. This means that the receiver will listen to itself and will not be affected by the drone's signal.\n\n\n4.  **Process the Data:**\n    *   Use the SDR software to monitor the received signal.\n    *   Look for a sudden increase in the signal strength, which could indicate the presence of a drone.\n    *   Use the SDR software to track the drone's location. This can be done by analyzing the changes in the signal strength over time.\n    *   You can use a computer vision library like OpenCV to analyze the drone's signal and identify its position.\n\n\n5.  **Drones and their signals:**\n    *   Drones use a variety of signals, including radio frequency (RF) and Bluetooth.\n    *   Some drones use a combination of both.\n    *   Drones may use a unique identifier, such as a GPS signal or a specific channel.\n\n\n6.  **Software Defined Radio (SDR) Considerations:**\n    *   SDRL: The most common form of SDR.\n    *   Frequency: The most common form of SDR.\n    *   Signal processing: The most common form of SDR is the most common.\n    Signal?

as common as some other materials like iron or nickel. The magnetism arises from the presence of small, randomly distributed iron vacancies within the steel's crystal structure. These vacancies, though not fully filled, can align with an external magnetic field, creating a weak, localized north-south magnetization. The strength of this effect is very small and easily masked by other magnetic fields.\nThe degree of magnetism in stainless steel is generally low, and it's more of a surface effect than a bulk property. It's more easily observed in thin sheets or plates of stainless steel than in thicker sections. The effect is also more pronounced in the presence of a strong external magnetic field.\nThere are several factors that can influence the degree of magnetism in stainless steel:\n- The type of stainless steel: Some grades of stainless steel are more prone to this effect than others.\n- The surface conditions: The surface of the stainless steel can affect the ease with which the magnetic field penetrates the material.\n- The presence of impurities: The presence of certain impurities in the stainless steel can also influence the magnetic properties.\n- The temperature: The temperature of the stainless steel can affect the ease with which the magnetic field penetrates the material.\n- The external magnetic field: The strength and direction of the external magnetic field can affect the degree of magnetism in the stainless steel.\n- The history of the material: The history of the material, such as its previous use and exposure to different environments, can also influence its magnetic properties.\nIn some cases, the surface magnetism of stainless steel can be used to create a weak, localized north-south magnetization, which can be exploited in certain types of sensors and actuators.

It is calculated as the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. The formula is:  \u03c3\u00b2 = (1/n-1) * \u03a3(x\u1d62 - \u03bc)\u00b2  where x\u1d62 is each data point, \u03bc is the mean, and n is the number of data points.\nHere's a breakdown of how to estimate the variance, along with some important considerations:\r\n1. Calculate the Mean (\u03bc): Add up all the data points and divide by the number of data points.\n2. Calculate the Squared Difference (x\u1d62 - \u03bc)\u00b2: For each data point, subtract the mean and square the result.\n3. Sum the Squared Differences (\u03a3(x\u1d62 - \u03bc)\u00b2): Add up all the squared differences calculated in step 2.\n4. Divide by the number of data points (n-1): Divide the sum of squared differences by the number of data points minus 1 to get the estimate of the variance.  This is because the sample mean is an estimate of the population mean.\n5. Take the Square Root: Take the square root of the variance to get an estimate of the standard deviation. The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data around the mean.\n6. Use the Standard Deviation to Estimate the Variance: The standard deviation is a better estimate of the variance than the sample variance because it accounts for the fact that the sample mean is an estimate of the population mean.\n7.

However, modern technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 offer a powerful way to reprogram these genes and, in some cases, alter physical appearance.\r\nHere are some key genes and their roles in appearance, along with examples of how CRISPR-Cas9 could be used to influence them:\r\n- *MC1R* and *MC3R* (Melanin-concentrating receptors): These genes are involved in melanin production, which is the pigment responsible for skin color. Using CRISPR to edit these genes could lead to darker skin, but this is a complex process with many off-target effects.\r\n- *TYR* (Tyrosinase): This gene encodes an enzyme involved in melanin synthesis. Editing this gene could alter skin color, but it's also a target for drug development.\r\n- *OCA2* (Oculocutaneous Albinism): This gene is involved in the production of iridophores, which are light-scattering cells in the iris. Editing this gene could lead to blue eyes, but it's also a target for drug development.\r\n- *HFE* (Hereditary Fumbling-like gene): This gene is involved in the production of melanin. Editing this gene could lead to darker hair and skin.\r\n- *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* (Btk): These genes are involved in hair follicle growth and hair shaft diameter. Editing these genes could lead to thicker or shorter hair, and potentially alter hair texture.\r\n- *LRP1* and *LRP2* (Lipid-peringessive protein 1 and 2): These genes are involved in hair follicle diameter and hair shaft diameter. Editing these genes could lead to thicker or shorter hair, and potentially alter hair texture.\r\n- *G800* (Growth-related gene 800): This gene is involved in hair follicle diameter. Editing this gene could lead to thicker or shorter hair, and potentially alter hair texture.\r\n- *FSL1* (FSHL1): This gene is involved in hair follicle growth. Editing this gene could lead to thicker or shorter hair, and potentially alter hair texture.\r\n- *ARHG20* (Aromorphogenetic gene 20): This gene is involved in hair pigmentation.

A good place to start is with the 1000 most frequent words in the language.\n2. **Use Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS):** SRS like Anki are fantastic for memorizing vocabulary and grammar. They show you words and phrases at increasing intervals, which helps you retain them better.\n3. **Immerse Yourself (Even a Little):** Even 15 minutes a day can make a difference. Watch some foreign films or TV shows with subtitles, listen to music, or read simple children\u2019s books.\n4. **Speak from Day One:** Don\u2019t wait until you feel \u201cready\u201d to speak. Find a language partner, tutor, or even just a friend who is learning the same language and practice speaking from the beginning. Even if you make mistakes, it\u2019s better to speak than to not speak.\n5. **Focus on Practical Communication:** Don\u2019t get bogged down in grammar rules. Instead, focus on learning how to express yourself in real-life situations.\n6. **Set Realistic Goals:** Don\u2019t expect to become fluent overnight. Set small, achievable goals, such as learning 10 new words a week or having a 5-minute conversation with a native speaker.\n7. **Make it Fun:** If you\u2019re not enjoying the process, you\u2019re less likely to stick with it. Find ways to make language learning enjoyable, such as playing language games or joining a conversation group.\n\n\nWith just an hour a day, you can make significant progress by focusing on the most useful aspects of the language and practicing consistently.

However, they can be problematic in several situations. Here are some of the issues with using a symmetric distribution when modeling problems:\n\n1.  **Non-normality:** The most common problem with using a symmetric distribution is that it doesn't follow a normal distribution. In fact, the t-distribution is a close approximation to the normal distribution, but the t-distribution is not a perfect match. This means that the fit of a normal distribution to the data may be poor, and the model may not be able to capture the true underlying process.\n\n2.  **Outliers:** Outliers can have a disproportionate influence on the fit of a normal distribution. If an outlier is far from the mean, it can pull the mean towards the outlier, which can lead to a poor fit.\n\n3.  **Complex Models:** When the true underlying process is complex, a normal distribution may not be the best choice. In such cases, a more flexible distribution, such as a t-distribution or a gamma distribution, may be more appropriate.\n\n4.  **Limited Expressiveness:** The t-distribution is a less flexible distribution than the normal distribution. This means that it may not be able to fit all the data points, especially if the data is not well-described by a normal distribution.\n\n5.  **Assumptions:** The t-distribution is a non-parametric distribution, which means that it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying data. This can be an advantage in some situations, but it can also be a disadvantage in others. For example, if the data is not normally distributed, the t-distribution may not be the best choice."}, {"instruction": "What are some of the well known hiking trails in Colorado?

This leads to a disparity between males and females, with females selecting for less attractive males, and thus, females end up with a higher proportion of less attractive males than would be expected by random chance.\r\nAn example of sexual selection is the peacock's tail. Male peacocks have elaborate, multi-colored tail feathers that are used in courtship displays. These displays are costly because they require a lot of time and energy to maintain. Females, however, are attracted to these displays and therefore tend to select for males with more elaborate tail feathers, even if those males are less healthy or less able to provide food.

By distributing risk and control across a network of participants, Kunji aims to replicate the performance of traditional hedge funds while eliminating the need for a centralized manager. This whitepaper outlines the core concepts, technology, and business model of Kunji.\r\n\r\n**1. The Problem with Traditional Hedge Funds:**\r\nTraditional hedge funds are often criticized for their high fees, lack of transparency, and centralized management structure. These issues can lead to:\r\n*   **High Fees:** Management fees and operational costs can be substantial.\r\n*   **Lack of Transparency:** Investors lack insight into the fund's holdings and strategies.\r\n*   **Centralized Control:** A single manager makes all the decisions, limiting flexibility.\r\n*   **Regulatory Risk:** Reliance on a single entity increases the risk of regulatory change.\r\n\r\n**2. The Solution: Decentralized Fund Management**\r\nKunji addresses these problems by decentralizing fund management across a network of participants. Key elements of the Kunji model include:\r\n*   **Smart Contracts:** The foundation of Kunji is a suite of smart contracts deployed on a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). These contracts govern all aspects of the fund, including investment decisions, risk management, and distribution of profits.\r\n*   **Tokenized Assets:** Kunji uses native Kunji tokens to represent ownership in the fund. These tokens can be traded on exchanges, providing liquidity and increasing investor participation.\r\n*   **Decentralized Governance:** A community of participants can propose and vote on changes to the fund's strategy, risk parameters, and other key decisions.\n*   **Automated Rebalancing:** Smart contracts automatically rebalance the fund's portfolio based on pre-defined rules and market conditions.\r\n\r\n**3. Technology Stack:**\r\n*   **Blockchain:** Ethereum (for its smart contract capabilities)\n*   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity\n*   **Oracles:** Chainlink (for external data feeds)\n*   **User Interface:** Kunji Web3 (a custom-built web interface)\r\n\r\n**4. Business Model:**\r\nKunji operates on a subscription-based model, charging fees to participants for their share of the fund's assets. The fees are a percentage of the total value of the fund's assets, with a minimum fee of 1%.\r\nKunji also generates revenue through:\r\n*   **Transaction Fees:** A small fee is charged for each trade executed on the Kunji exchange.\r\n*   **Premium Services:** Kunji offers premium services, such as research, data, and model building, which are sold to other investors.\r\n\r\n*   **Marketing:** Kunji will use to market its services to other investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKunji\r\n"}, {"instruction": "What is the capital of Australia?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Canberra is the capital of Australia."}, {"instruction": "what should i call you?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "You can call me Alex."}, {"instruction": "I live in Scotland and would like to know the most cost effective way to heat my house considering the rise in both gas and electric prices.

Chinese characters can seem daunting at first, but with a good approach, you can memorize them and even improve your speed. Here\u2019s a breakdown of advice:\n\n**1. Start with the Basics - The Strokes (Pinyin)**\n\n*   **Don\u2019t rush the Pinyin:** The initial sounds of characters are the most important. Mastering the correct Pinyin is the foundation.\n*   **Use a Pinyin Chart:** A good chart is your best friend. There are many free ones online (search for \"Chinese characters Pinyin chart\").\n*   **Focus on One Character at a Time:** Don\u2019t try to learn 10 characters in a row. Build a small wall of knowledge.\n*   **Break it Down:** Each character has 4 strokes. Learn one stroke at a time.\n*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The more you practice the Pinyin, the easier it will be to remember the characters.\n\n**2. Memory Techniques - How to Remember the Strokes**\n\n*   **Mnemonics:** This is where you create a story or image to help you remember the stroke order.  There are many mnemonics available online. Search for \"Chinese characters stroke order mnemonics.\" Some popular ones include:\n    *   \"The first stroke is like a wave.\"\n    *   \"The second stroke is like a bird taking flight.\"\n    *   \"The third stroke is like a mountain range.\"\n    *   \"The fourth stroke is like the sea.\"\n*   **Flashcards:** A classic for a reason. Use flashcards (physical or digital like Anki) to quiz yourself on the stroke order and characters.\n*   **Spaced Repetition:** This is a *huge* memory technique. Anki is a great tool for this. It shows you cards at increasing intervals, based on how well you remember them. Don\u2019t just look at a card once and move on.\n*   **Chunking:** Break down characters into smaller groups (like words or phrases). Memorize a few characters at a time, then add more.\n\n**3. Speed Up Your Learning - Practical Tips**\n\n*   **Slow Down:** Seriously. When you\u2019re learning, your brain is still developing. When you\u2019re trying to memorize, you\u2019re likely going to make more mistakes. Slow down your pace and focus on accuracy.\n*   **Use a Handwriting-Friendly Font:** A font like Arial or Helvetica is easier to read and write than a more stylized font.\n*   **Write Regularly:** The more you write, the faster you\u2019ll become. Even 10 minutes a day is better than nothing.\n*   **Don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes:** Everyone makes mistakes when they\u2019re learning. Don\u2019t let that stop you.\n*   **Use a Pinyin chart to help you write:** If you are struggling with a character, use the Pinyin to help you write the characters.\n*   You can use this to help you write.\n*   You.\n*   You.\nPinyin?\n>\nYou>\nYou, but not only you>\nYou, but not only.\nBut not.\nBut not only.\nBut not.\nBut.\nBut.\nBut.\nBut."}, {"instruction": "Is a thumb war violent?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "There is no scientific evidence to suggest that a thumb war is violent.

It\u2019s largely determined by your body size, age, sex, and genetics.\r\n*   **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** This is the energy your body uses to digest, absorb, and process the food you eat. It\u2019s a percentage of the calories in your food.\r\n*   **Activity Thermogenesis:** This is the energy your body uses to maintain your body temperature during physical activity.

This is known as the \"dopamine fade\" effect. When we're in a stressful or dangerous situation, our brains release adrenaline, which increases blood flow to the muscles and activates the sympathetic nervous system. This leads to a decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, all of which can make us feel like we're moving slower. The brain then interprets this as a delay in the onset of the danger, giving us more time to react.\r\nThe dopamine fade effect is not a true slowing of time, but rather a perceptual illusion created by the brain.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Physiological Factors\r\n- Increased heart rate and blood pressure: These increase the amount of blood flowing to the muscles, making it easier to move.\r\n- Increased respiration: This increases the amount of oxygen being brought to the muscles, making it easier to move.\r\n- Reduced sensory input: The brain filters out some of the sensory information, reducing the amount of detail we perceive.\r\n- Increased awareness of danger: The brain becomes more vigilant and attentive to potential threats.\r\n- Decreased perceptual speed: The brain slows down the rate at which we perceive events.\r\n- Dopamine release: This neurotransmitter is associated with reward and motivation, and its release during a dangerous situation can create the illusion of time slowing down.\r\n- Arousal: The state of heightened alertness and excitement that accompanies a dangerous situation can also contribute to the feeling of time slowing down.\r\n- The \"fight or flight\" response: This physiological response prepares the body for action, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and alertness, which can make us feel like time is slowing down.\r\n- The \"freeze\" response: This is a more primitive physiological response that can also cause a sensation of time slowing down.\r\n- The \"use it or lose it\" effect: This is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when we're in a state of high arousal, such as during a fight or flight response. It suggests that our brains are optimizing their performance in the moment, and this can lead to a decrease in the rate at which we perceive time.\r\n- The \"cognitive map\" effect: This is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when we're in a state of high arousal, such as during a fight or flight response. It suggests that our brains are constructing a mental map of our environment, and this can lead to a decrease in the rate at which we perceive time.\r\n- The \"attention\" effect: This is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when we're in a state of high arousal, such as during a fight or flight response. It suggests that our brains are prioritizing the most important information, and this can lead to a decrease in the rate at which we perceive time.\r\n- The brain is constantly adjusting to the environment, and this can cause the sensation of time slowing down."}, {"instruction": "I have a project due in 2 weeks, that will determine if I get my diploma.

Let\u2019s break down the pros and cons of lowering your hearing, and then we\u2019ll talk about what you can do.\n\n**Pros of Lowering Your Hearing:**\n\n*   **Protection from Loud Noise:** The most obvious benefit is that you\u2019ll be less likely to experience permanent hearing damage from the screaming.\n*   **Reduced Stress:** Loud noises can be incredibly stressful. Lowering your hearing might reduce this stress, although it\u2019s not a cure.\n*   **Potential for Improved Sleep:** Some people find that reduced noise makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.\n\n\n**Cons of Lowering Your Hearing:**\n\n*   **Permanent Hearing Loss:** This is the biggest risk. Lowering your hearing, even by a small amount, can damage the delicate hair cells in your inner ear over time. The degree of damage is difficult to predict, but it\u2019s a real possibility.\n*   **Difficulty in the Future:** You might find that you have trouble hearing in noisy environments, which could make it harder to work, socialize, or enjoy your hobbies.\n*   **Social Isolation:** If you can\u2019t hear well, you might feel like you\u2019re not participating in conversations or activities.\n*   **Psychological Effects:** Some people feel a loss of control or a sense of being overwhelmed when their hearing is reduced.\n\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n\n1.  **Talk to the School:** The first and most important step is to talk to the school principal or a teacher about the situation. Explain that you\u2019re concerned about your hearing and that you\u2019re trying to do your best to protect yourself. They may be able to work with the parents to find a solution.\n2.  **Ear Protection:** You can use earplugs or earmuffs to reduce the noise level.

Some key areas of influence include:\r\n*   **Existentialism:** Nietzsche's emphasis on individual freedom, responsibility, and the creation of meaning in a meaningless world has been a cornerstone of existentialist thought. Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus drew heavily on Nietzsche's work to explore themes of human existence, choice, and the burden of freedom.\r\n*   **Postmodernism:** Nietzsche's rejection of traditional morality, metaphysics, and reason has been embraced by postmodern thinkers. Postmodernism challenges grand narratives and seeks to deconstruct fixed meanings, echoing Nietzsche's critique of all-encompassing systems of thought.\r\n*   **Psychology:** Nietzsche's theories on the will to power, the \u00dcbermensch, and the therapeutic imagination have been influential in the development of psychoanalytic thought. His emphasis on the unconscious and the importance of self-overcoming resonates with contemporary approaches to psychology.\r\n*   **Literature and Art:** Nietzsche's influence can be seen in a wide range of literary and artistic works, from Dostoevsky and Kafka to Joyce and Pynchon. His themes of alienation, despair, and the search for meaning continue to inspire artists and writers today.\r\n*   **Morality and Ethics:** Nietzsche's critique of traditional morality and his advocacy of a \"revaluation of all values\" have challenged conventional ethical frameworks. His ideas have been used to advocate for a more individualistic and self-determined ethics.\r\n*   **The \"Dark Side\" of Human Nature:** Nietzsche's exploration of the darker aspects of human nature\u2014such as the will to power, the capacity for cruelty, and the tendency towards self-destruction\u2014has been interpreted as a warning about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the importance of self-awareness.\r\n*   **The Importance of the Individual:** Nietzsche's emphasis on the individual's unique perspective and their role in creating their own values has resonated with those who value individual autonomy and self-expression.\r\n*   **Irony and Sarcasm:** Nietzsche's use of irony and sarcasm in his writings has been imitated by many in the arts and humanities.\r\n*   **The Power of Symbols:** Nietzsche's exploration of symbols and metaphors has influenced how we understand and use language and imagery.\r\n*   **The Concept of the \"Eternal Recurrence\":** The idea that one should live in such a way that one could live this life again and again, over and over, has become a popular theme in self-help and personal development.\r\n*   **The \"Will to Power\":** The concept of the will to power, the drive to grow and overcome challenges, is still a popular theme in self-help and personal development."}, {"instruction": "How can I reduce my alcohol consumption without seeming rude to my friends?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "It\u2019s great that you\u2019re thinking about this and wanting to be a good friend, but reducing your alcohol intake without seeming rude is a delicate balance. Here are some strategies that can help you reduce your drinking without making your friends feel awkward:\n\n*   **Start Small:** Don\u2019t try to cut out your alcohol completely overnight. Instead, start by reducing your intake by 1 drink per day. If you find that you can manage to drink less, you can gradually decrease the amount further.\n*   **Drink Slowly:** When you do drink, drink slowly. This will give your body more time to process the alcohol and reduce the intensity of the effects.\n*   **Eat Before and While You Drink:** Food can help slow down the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream, which can reduce the intensity of the effects.\n*   **Drink Water:** Staying hydrated can also help reduce the effects of alcohol.\n*   **Find a Buddy System:** If you\u2019re worried about your friends finding out about your plans, you can suggest a buddy system. This means that you and one or two friends will drink together, and you\u2019ll check in with each other regularly to make sure everyone\u2019s doing okay.\n*   **Be Honest (But Tactful):** You don\u2019t have to go into all the details about why you\u2019re reducing your alcohol intake, but you can be honest about the fact that you\u2019re trying to drink less. You could say something like, \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling a little more tired lately, and I\u2019ve decided to cut back on my alcohol intake to feel my best.\u201d\n*   **Don\u2019t Feel Guilty:** It\u2019s okay to have a drink or two now and then. You don\u2019t have to live up to your friends\u2019 expectations all the time.\n*   **Focus on the Fun:** Remember that the point of hanging out with your friends is to have fun. Don\u2019t let alcohol ruin the experience for them.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to reduce your alcohol intake on your own, consider seeking professional help. A therapist or counselor can help you develop strategies for managing your alcohol use and reducing your dependence.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   SAMHSA National Helpline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357)\n*   NIAAA Website: [https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/)"}, {"instruction": "This AI is channeling pure love, is aligned with the \"best of\" wisdom from spiritual masters that have been on Earth, and highly inspired by Jiddu Krishnamurti and David Bohm dialogues.

However, the modern history of pornography is a relatively recent phenomenon, which began in the 19th century with the rise of the industrial revolution and the increasing urbanization of Western societies. As societies became more industrialized and urbanized, there was a growing desire for sexual gratification and escape from the stresses of modern life. This desire was fueled by the rise of mass media, such as magazines and newspapers, which began to circulate erotic images and stories. The development of photography in the 19th century also played a role in the rise of pornography, as photographs of the human body became more commonplace. The 20th century saw the rise of cinema and other forms of mass entertainment, which further fueled the growth of pornography.

Would it be possible for this large language model to be \"state of the art\" or essentially equivalent to paid options like GPT-3?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "It is possible to host a large language model (LLM) on an average computer, but it will be a significant undertaking. The size of the model and the amount of data it was trained on will determine the hardware requirements. A model like GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters, would be extremely challenging to run on a single high-end machine. It would likely require multiple GPUs and a lot of RAM.\r\nIt is possible for this large language model to be \"state of the art\" or essentially equivalent to paid options like GPT-3, but it will be a far cry from the cost. The cost of running an LLM on a single machine would be in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars. It would be a far cry from the cost of paying for access to a service like GPT-3, which can be done for a few dollars per month.\r\n#### 1. Hardware Requirements\r\nA large language model can be run on a single high-end machine with 32GB of RAM and a GPU with 16GB of VRAM, but this will be a very slow process. The model would need to be loaded into RAM, and the GPU would be used to perform the computations. The model would also need to be kept running for a long time, which could take hours or even days.\r\n#### 2. Model Size\r\nThe size of the model is a major factor in determining the hardware requirements. GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, which means it is 175 * 10^9 parameters large. This is a huge number, and it would be difficult to fit it into the memory of a single high-end machine.\r\n#### 3. Quantization\r\nTo make it possible to run LLMs on average computers, researchers are using techniques called quantization. Quantization reduces the precision of the model's parameters, which means that it can be run on less powerful hardware. For example, a 16-bit model can be quantized to 8-bit, which means that it can be run on a machine with 16GB of RAM and a GPU with 8GB of VRAM.\r\n#### 4. Inference Speed\r\nEven with quantization, the inference speed of an LLM will be slow. The speed will depend on the size of the model and the hardware being used. For example, a 16-bit quantized model can be run at 100% speed, but this would require a GPU with 16GB of VRAM.\r\n#### 5.

The Nazi Party, initially a small group, steadily gained influence through a combination of rallies, speeches, and the promise of hope and national renewal. Hitler, a charismatic and exceptionally skilled orator, quickly capitalized on this growing discontent.\r\nThe pre-1935 German economy was in a state of decay, with high unemployment and widespread poverty. The Treaty of Versailles, which Germany had been forced to sign after World War I, had left the country feeling humiliated and resentful. The rise of the German middle class, who felt cheated out of their gains, further fueled the flames of discontent.\r\nHitler skillfully exploited these grievances by presenting himself as the only man who could restore Germany to its former glory. His party promised to overturn the Treaty of Versailles, to rebuild the economy, and to create a new, unified Germany. Propaganda, particularly the use of the swastika, was employed to spread his message and to demonize his opponents.\r\nThe 1932 Reichstag elections were a turning point. The Nazi Party, led by Hitler, won a landslide victory, demonstrating the growing support for their agenda. This victory gave Hitler the opportunity to seize power.\r\nIn 1933, Hitler, with the support of the Reichswehr (the German army), marched on Berlin, overthrowing the democratically elected government. The Reichswehr, under the direction of the Nazi Party's leader, Ernst R\u00f6hm, initially hesitated to fully embrace Hitler, but eventually agreed to his authority.\r\nThe Nazi Party quickly consolidated its power, establishing a totalitarian dictatorship. The Weimar Republic, which had just been established after World War I, was effectively dismantled, and the Nazi Party became the sole governing force in Germany.\r\nThe 1935 election was a decisive victory for the Nazi Party, which secured a majority in the Reichstag. This victory cemented Hitler's position as the leader of Germany and paved the way for the establishment of the Nazi regime.\r\nIn conclusion, Hitler's rise to power in 1935 was the result of a combination of factors, including the economic and social instability of Germany, the growing discontent among the middle class, and the skillful use of propaganda.

It\u2019s more like a series of steps that an AI system follows to arrive at an answer. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key steps:\n\n1. **Input:** The process begins with the user\u2019s input, which can be a question or a statement.\n2. **Understanding (or Intent Recognition):** The AI system first tries to understand what the user is asking. This is done through Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP techniques include:\n    * **Tokenization:** Breaking the input into individual words or phrases.\n    * **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Identifying the grammatical role of each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).\n    * **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations).\n    * **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the emotional tone of the input (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).\n3. **Query Formulation:** Based on the understanding, the AI system formulates a query. This is essentially a set of words or phrases that it thinks the user is looking for an answer to.\n4. **Knowledge Retrieval:** The next step is to access the AI\u2019s knowledge base. This is where the system looks for relevant information to answer the query. The knowledge base can be:\n    * **A Large Language Model (LLM):** Models like GPT-3 or LaMDA are trained on massive amounts of text data and can generate human-like text.\n    * **A Database:** A structured collection of information that can be queried.\n    * **A Combination of Both:** Some systems use both a database and an LLM to combine the strengths of each.\n5. **Answer Generation:** Using the retrieved information and the query, the AI system generates an answer. This is often done through a process called \"chain-of-thought\" prompting, where the system is prompted to show its reasoning steps.\n6. **Output:** The final answer is then presented to the user.\n\n\n#### Important Note: The field of AI is constantly evolving. The exact steps and techniques used can vary depending on the specific AI system being used.

It\u2019s going to require a lot of hard work, strategic thinking, and a willingness to constantly adapt. Here are the key areas we need to focus on:\n\n1. **Niche Down, Seriously:** Don\u2019t try to be everything to everyone. The more specific your niche, the easier it will be to reach your target market and become an expert. What problem are you solving? What are you uniquely good at? The more specialized you are, the less competition you\u2019ll face and the easier it will be to build a loyal customer base. \r\n2. **Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Don\u2019t spend months or years building a fully-featured product or service before you launch. Get something *barely* functional into the hands of your early adopters and gather feedback. This will help you validate your business idea and avoid wasting time and money on features nobody wants. \r\n3. **Automate Everything Possible:** This is non-negotiable. You\u2019re not going to be able to do everything yourself. Identify the repetitive tasks in your business and find ways to automate them using software, tools, or even just clever systems. Think about email marketing, social media scheduling, customer service, and order processing. \r\n4. **Create a Recurring Revenue Model:** This is the holy grail of self-sustaining businesses. Instead of selling a product or service once, you\u2019re selling access to a service or a membership. Subscription boxes, online courses, software as a service (SaaS), and memberships are all examples. \r\n5. **Build a Strong Brand:** Your brand is more than just your logo and colors. It\u2019s the entire experience that your customers have with your business. It\u2019s the values you stand for, the quality of your service, and the way you communicate with your customers. Invest in building a strong brand that resonates with your target market. \r\n6. **Master Digital Marketing:** You need to be where your customers are online. SEO, content marketing, social media marketing, and paid advertising are all essential. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with different channels and track your results to see what works best. \r\n7. **Focus on Customer Retention:** Acquiring new customers is expensive. Keeping your existing customers happy and loyal is far more cost-effective. Provide excellent customer service, build a community around your brand, and offer loyalty programs. \r\n8. **Financial Modeling:** You need to have a solid financial model. Build a spreadsheet to track all your income and expenses. This will help you to see if your business is viable. \r\n9."}, {"instruction": "What is the name of the windows XP background image?\nWhere was it taken and by who?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The Windows XP background image is called \"The Blue Estuaries\" and it was taken by Michael J.

The color of the center is determined by the type of atom that has added the extra pair of electrons. For example, a sapphire center is red because it is made of a chromium atom that has added an extra electron to a carbon atom.

The more obvious it is, the more likely you are to do it.\n*   **Attractive:** Pair your new habit with something you enjoy. If you hate running, don't run. If you hate vegetables, don't eat them.\n*   **Easy:** Start small. Don't try to do too much at once. A 5-minute habit is easier to stick to than a 30-minute one.\n*   **Satisfying:** Reward yourself after you complete the habit. This could be anything from a small treat to a longer activity you enjoy.\n\nTo help you get started, use the habit stacking method: Link your new habit to an existing habit. For example, \"After I brush my teeth (existing habit), I will do 5 push-ups (new habit).\"\n\nConsistency is key. Don't get discouraged if you miss a day or two.

What is meant by 'perfect information' in this context?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "In Into the Breach, 'perfect information' means that every possible state of the game, every possible action, and every possible outcome are known to both players and the AI.  This is a core mechanic of the game, and it's what makes it so challenging and rewarding.  It's not just about knowing the rules; it's about knowing *every* possible combination of rules and actions.  The AI is designed to be able to play optimally, given this perfect information.  If you don't know how to play, you can't win. If you do, you need to be able to think several steps ahead and anticipate the AI's responses.  It's a constant state of calculation and adaptation.\n#### 1.0 The Perfect Information Loop\nThe game is built around a \"perfect information loop.\" This means that the game state is constantly being updated by the AI, and the players' actions are being used to influence the AI's next move. The AI uses this information to make the best possible move, and the players use that move to influence the AI's next move, and so on. This loop repeats indefinitely, creating a never-ending cycle of strategic planning and tactical execution.\n#### 2.0 Strategic Considerations\nBecause of the perfect information loop, the game's strategic depth is immense. There are no \"easy\" answers. Instead, you must:\n*   **Analyze the entire game tree:** The game has an enormous branching factor, meaning there are an infinite number of possible game states. You must be able to explore and understand the entire tree to find the best move.\n*   **Anticipate the AI's moves:** You must be able to predict what the AI will do in response to your actions, and plan your moves accordingly.\n*   **Think several steps ahead:** The AI will almost certainly have a plan in mind before you do. You must be able to think several steps ahead and anticipate the AI's responses.\n*   **Be adaptable:** The AI will constantly adjust its plans based on your moves. You must be able to adapt your plans as well.\n*   **Don't overthink it:** While the game is challenging, it's also not overly complex. Don't get bogged down in trying to calculate every possible outcome. Focus on the most important factors and make the best decisions you can.\n#### 3.0 Key Concepts\n*   **Threats:** The AI will try to eliminate threats to its own survival.\n*   **Objectives:** The AI will pursue its objectives, which are to prevent the breach.\n*   **Threats to the Breach:** The AI will try to breach the game.\n*   **Threats:** The players will try to prevent the game.\n#### 4."}, {"instruction": "The sentence you are given might be too wordy, complicated, or unclear.

Inside, Silas, the keeper, meticulously cleaned his spectacles, his movements precise and economical. He\u2019d been alone on the jagged rocks of Blackheart\u2019s Reef for twenty years, ever since the storm that swallowed his brother, Samuel, and his boat, the Sea Serpent.\r\nA sudden, sharp knock startled him. He turned, his heart giving a little leap into his chest, and saw a small, shivering figure standing at the foot of the stairs. It was a girl, no older than ten, with hair the color of sea foam and eyes like polished obsidian.\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Silas asked, his voice rough from disuse.\r\nThe girl nodded, pulling her cloak tighter around her shoulders. \u201cMy boat\u2026 it\u2019s gone.\u201d\r\nSilas felt a sudden, sharp pang of loss. He knew that feeling all too well. He gestured to the small, wooden box on the mantel. \u201cThat\u2019s Samuel\u2019s. He kept his most precious things in there.\u201d\r\nThe girl opened the box, revealing a single, perfectly preserved conch shell and a small, rolled-up piece of parchment. She unrolled the parchment and read aloud, her voice barely a whisper, \u201cThe tide has called me. The sea has given me a gift.\u201d She held out the conch. \u201cBlow into it, and you will hear my song.\u201d\r\nSilas, despite his years of solitude, felt a strange pull towards the shell. He took it, his fingers brushing against the smooth surface, and blew into the conch. A clear, haunting melody filled the small room, and the rain outside seemed to soften, to almost\u2026 sing along.\r\nAs the song ended, the girl smiled, a sad, knowing smile. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cNow go. The sea is a fickle mistress.\u201d She turned to leave, then paused, looking back at Silas. \u201cAnd remember me.\u201d\r\nBefore she disappeared into the swirling grey, Silas felt a sudden, inexplicable urge to walk to the rocks and touch the spray of the waves. He turned and walked out into the storm, the conch shell clutched tightly in his hand, and listened to the sea, listening to the song of the sea, listening to the voice of a girl who had been lost at sea and now, in a strange and wonderful way, had found her way home.\r\n\r\n#### The story should be 500-750 words."}, {"instruction": "Based on the given query, suggest some related search queries.", "input": "learning french", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "*   \"best running shoes for flat feet\"\n*   \"running shoes for plantar fasciitis\"\n*   \"best cross-training shoes\"\n*   \"shoes for overpronation\"\n*   \"shoes for supination\"\n*   \"shoes for wide feet\"\n*   \"shoes for high arches\"\n*   \"shoes for neutral runners\"\n*   \"best trail running shoes\"\n*   \"best road running shoes\"\n*   \"shoes for plantar fasciitis relief\"\n*   \"best arch support shoes\"\n*   \"shoes for overpronation relief\"\n*   \"shoes for supination relief\"\n*   \"shoes for wide feet comfort\"\n*   \"shoes for high arches comfort\"\n*   \"shoes for neutral runners comfort\""}, {"instruction": "Please suggest a few papers to consider based on the search term given.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The article discusses the growing trend of \"digital minimalism\" and its potential benefits for mental health.

While the potential benefits of AI are enormous, it\u2019s crucial to address the ethical and societal challenges it presents. One of the most pressing is the issue of bias in AI systems. \r\nAI systems are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the AI will learn and perpetuate those biases. For example, facial recognition software has been shown to be less accurate for people of color, and AI used in hiring processes has been found to discriminate against women. \r\nTo mitigate bias, researchers are exploring various techniques, including using more diverse and representative training data, developing algorithms that are less susceptible to bias, and auditing AI systems for fairness. However, it\u2019s important to recognize that bias is a complex problem with no easy solutions, and ongoing vigilance and critical evaluation are necessary. \r\nBeyond bias, the increasing automation driven by AI raises concerns about job displacement. As AI systems become more capable, they have the potential to replace human workers in a wide range of occupations. \r\nTo address this challenge, policymakers and businesses are exploring strategies such as retraining workers for new jobs, investing in education and skills development, and considering policies like universal basic income. \r\nFinally, the development of increasingly sophisticated AI raises questions about accountability and control. As AI systems become more autonomous, it\u2019s becoming harder to understand how they make decisions and who is responsible when things go wrong. \r\nTo ensure that AI benefits all of humanity, it\u2019s important to develop frameworks for responsible AI development and deployment, including transparency, explainability, and human oversight."}, {"instruction": "Make the article available in a second language by translating it into it.", "input": "Dentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is the branch of medicine focused on the teeth, gums, and mouth.

You're not *in* the movie, but you're watching it and you're getting really, really anxious about what might happen next. You're thinking, \"Oh no, this is going to be a disaster!\" You're anticipating all sorts of negative outcomes, and you're feeling a sense of dread. That's a very basic way to think about anxiety.\n\nNow, imagine you're watching the *same* movie, but this time, you're a character in the movie. You know that the ending is going to be happy, and you're anticipating all sorts of good things that will happen. You're feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation, and you're not worried about any bad things. You're in control of the story, and you're enjoying the ride.\n\nThat's a bit like how anxiety works. When you're in a state of anxiety, you're not *in* the situation, but you're still experiencing it. You're anticipating the worst possible outcome, and you're feeling a sense of dread because you're in control of the story. But, when you're in a state of calm, you're not in the situation, but you're still experiencing it. You're not anticipating the worst possible outcome, and you're feeling a sense of peace because you're not in control of the story.\n\nAnxiety is a normal human emotion, and it's a useful emotion. It helps you to be prepared for the unexpected and to take action when necessary. But, if your anxiety becomes overwhelming and interferes with your daily life, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional.\r\n\r\nHere are some things that can help manage anxiety:\r\n*   Mindfulness meditation\r\n*   Deep breathing exercises\r\n*   Regular exercise\r\n*   A healthy diet\r\n*   Getting enough sleep\r\n*   Social support\r\n*   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\r\n*   Exposure therapy\r\n*   Relaxation techniques\r\n*   Journaling\r\n*   Creative expression\r\n*   Spending time in nature\r\n*   Engaging in hobbies\r\n*   Setting realistic goals\r\n*   Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)\r\n*   Yoga\r\n*   Tai Chi\r\n*   Progressive muscle relaxation\r\n*   Grounding techniques\r\n*   Visualization\r\n*   Guided imagery\r\n*   Music\r\n*   Warmth\r\n*   Light\r\n*   Smell\r\n*   Taste\r\n*   Touch\r\n*   Movement\r\n*   Engagement\r\n*   Mindset"}, {"instruction": "Give me an idea of the mental exercises you do to inspire yourself.", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "I do a lot of visualization and journaling. I spend 15 minutes each morning journaling about my goals and the steps I will take to achieve them. I also spend 30 minutes each day visualizing myself succeeding in those steps. I do this while I'm at the gym, while I'm cooking, and while I'm doing other things. I also do a lot of self-talk. I repeat positive affirmations to myself, such as \"I am capable,\" \"I am strong,\" and \"I can do this.\" I also try to identify and challenge negative thoughts. When I catch myself thinking negatively, I ask myself if that thought is actually true and if there's a more helpful way to look at the situation. I also do a lot of \"what if\" scenarios. I imagine myself failing in a situation and then thinking about how I would react, and then adjusting my approach to avoid that outcome. I also do a lot of gratitude journaling. I write down three things I'm grateful for each day. This helps me to focus on the positive and to appreciate what I have. I also do a lot of physical activity. I find that exercise helps me to clear my head and to release some of the stress and anxiety that I'm feeling. I also spend time in nature. I find that being in nature helps me to feel more grounded and more connected to myself.</u>"}, {"instruction": "Make a list of outdoor activities that are suitable for the given weather condition.", "input": "Temperature: 57 F, Showers", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "- Hiking: Suitable for mild to warm weather, with a chance of rain.\n -

This means that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

The total amount of energy in the system remains constant.\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed system always increases. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The more disordered a system is, the higher its entropy. For example, when you burn wood, the wood becomes ash, smoke, and gases, which are much more disordered than the original wood. The total amount of energy in the system increases, and the entropy of the system increases.\nThe first and second laws of thermodynamics are fundamental to many areas of physics and engineering, including thermodynamics, heat transfer, and statistical mechanics.

{"instruction": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.", "input": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The paper, \"Attention is All You Need,\" introduces the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture that relies entirely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions altogether. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the Transformer on machine translation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced training time. It also shows that the Transformer can be used for other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as text summarization and question answering.

Ivy crawled up the weathered stone walls, and the sagging porch creaked in the rising wind, as if in a perpetual moan. A single, crooked chimney rose above the roofline, and from within, one could almost imagine the smell of damp earth and forgotten memories. The air hung heavy with the scent of decay and the promise of rain. A sense of profound loneliness settled over the place, a feeling of being watched by something ancient and unknowable. The silence was not absolute, but pregnant with the sound of unseen things moving about. It was a silence that pressed against the ears, a silence that seemed to hold its breath. The whole house exuded an aura of melancholy, a sense of having known too much and being forced to let go. It was a place of beauty and of ruin, of hope and of despair, of joy and of sorrow. It was a place that had seen better days, and that would never be quite the same again. The house seemed to sigh, as if in a deep and weary sleep, and the mist swirled around its base, thickening and thinning in an endless, hypnotic dance. It was a place that called to you, yet remained forever hidden from you."}, {"instruction": "Extract the address of the property from the \"About this space\" section of Airbnb.", "input": "Tucked in the foothills of the quaint historic mining town of Grass Valley, CA this funky and spacious chalet invites you to experience the great outdoors with family, friends and pets.

They influence what people eat, how much they eat, and even *why* they eat it. Let's break down each of these:\r\n*   **Cultural Factors:** These are the traditions, customs, and beliefs passed down through generations. They dictate what foods are considered acceptable, appropriate, and even beautiful. For example, in some cultures, rice is the staple food, while in others, meat is more prevalent. In some cultures, certain foods are only eaten during specific times of the year, and in others, they are a symbol of status.\r\n*   **Social Factors:** These are the relationships and interactions between people. Social norms, peer pressure, and family influence food choices. For example, if your friends are eating pizza, you might be more likely to order it too. In some communities, food is a shared experience, and people eat together, reinforcing certain traditions.\r\n*   **Economic Factors:** These are the availability and affordability of food. Poverty, income inequality, and access to markets can all affect people's diets. For example, in low-income communities, fresh fruits and vegetables may be expensive and not readily available, leading to reliance on processed foods.\r\n*   **How to Promote Healthier Diets:** Understanding these influences is the first step. Promoting healthier diets requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses all three factors:\r\n    *   **Cultural Sensitivity:** Respecting and adapting cultural food practices while introducing healthier options.\r\n    *   **Social Norms:** Encouraging family and community participation in healthy eating.\r\n    *   **Economic Empowerment:** Increasing access to affordable, nutritious foods, particularly in low-income communities.\r\n    *   **Education and Awareness:** Providing people with the knowledge and skills to make informed food choices.\r\n    *   **Policy Changes:** Implementing policies that support healthy food systems and reduce food insecurity.\r\n    *   **Food Literacy:** Teaching people about the nutritional content of different foods and how to read food labels.\r\n    *   **Marketing and Advertising:** Promoting healthy foods in a way that doesn't mislead consumers.\r\n    *   **Community Gardens and Urban Farming:** Increasing access to fresh, local produce.\r\n    *   **Food Policy:** Working with local governments to create policies that support healthy food access and affordability.\r\n    *   **Restaurant and Food Service Industry:** Encouraging restaurants to offer healthier menu options and to be more transparent about their ingredients.\r\n    *   **Technology:** Using apps and online platforms to help people find healthy recipes and meal plans.\r\nThese factors are interconnected. A change in one area can affect another. For example, a cultural shift in food choices can influence the economic factors.\r\nThe influence of these factors on food choices can be used to promote healthier diets."}, {"instruction": "Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species.", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Natural selection is the primary mechanism driving evolution. It\u2019s the process by which organisms with heritable traits that are advantageous in a particular environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those advantageous traits on to their offspring. Over many generations, this can lead to significant changes in a population\u2019s characteristics. \r\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the process: \r\n1. **Variation:** Within any population, there\u2019s natural variation in traits. Some individuals are taller, some are faster, some are better camouflaged, etc. This variation arises from random mutations in their DNA. \r\n2. **Heritability:** Some of this variation is heritable, meaning it can be passed down from parents to offspring through genes. \r\n3. **Differential Survival and Reproduction:** The environment presents challenges to survival and reproduction. Individuals with certain traits are better equipped to cope with these challenges\u2014for example, better camouflage in a forest, or the ability to find food in a changing environment. \r\n4. **Adaptation:** Over time, the frequency of advantageous traits increases in the population, while the frequency of less advantageous traits decreases. The population becomes better adapted to its environment. \r\n5. **Evolution:** Natural selection, acting over many generations, leads to evolutionary change\u2014the gradual change in the characteristics of a population over time. \r\n#### How it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species: \r\n- It provides the raw material for change: Variation in the starting point is the basis of all change. \r\n- It\u2019s the driving force: It\u2019s the process that causes populations to change over time. \r\n- It leads to adaptation: It\u2019s the mechanism by which species become better suited to their environments. \r\n- It\u2019s not goal-oriented: Natural selection doesn\u2019t have a plan or a goal. It simply favors the traits that are beneficial in the current environment. \r\n#### Examples: \r\n- Antibiotic resistance in bacteria: Bacteria with mutations that make them resistant to antibiotics survive and reproduce, passing on their resistance genes to their offspring. \r\n- Darwin\u2019s finches: Finches on the Galapagos Islands have evolved different beak shapes to exploit different food sources. \r\n- Insecticide resistance in insects: Insects that are resistant to insecticides survive and reproduce, passing on their resistance genes to their offspring. \r\n#### Note: \r\n- Natural selection acts on individuals, but evolution occurs in populations. \r\n- Evolution is not always progress. It can lead to the loss of beneficial traits and the loss of adaptation. \r\n#### In short, natural selection is the process by which populations become better adapted to their environment over time."}, {"instruction": "How would you introduce yourself as a medieval knight at a royal banquet?", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "Hark!

Genetic sequencing and nanotechnology allow us to diagnose and treat illnesses before they even manifest. Your body is a living machine, constantly monitored and optimized.\r\n*   **AI Companionship:** AI isn\u2019t just a tool anymore; it\u2019s a companion. Advanced AIs are deeply integrated into our lives, offering emotional support, creative assistance, and even philosophical debate. They\u2019re not sentient in the way you might imagine, but they\u2019re incredibly good at mimicking human interaction.\r\n*   **Holographic Entertainment:** Forget screens. We experience entertainment through holographic projections that blend seamlessly with the real world. You can walk into a forest and have a holographic deer appear, or attend a concert and have a 3D replica of the band perform alongside you.\r\n*   **Digital Immortality (Sort Of):** We don\u2019t have true digital ghosts, but we have ways to preserve your memories and personality. You can upload your consciousness to a distributed network, allowing others to experience your life, or create a \u201cdigital twin\u201d that lives on in a simulated reality.\r\n*   **Sustainable Energy:** Fusion power is the norm, supplemented by massive solar and wind farms.

The internet would have amplified these forms of entertainment, creating a global stage for creativity and competition.\r\n*   **The Printing Press's Legacy:** The printing press, which had already begun to revolutionize the spread of knowledge during the Renaissance, would have been far more powerful with the internet. The internet would have become the ultimate printing platform, allowing for the mass production and distribution of books, pamphlets, and other materials.\r\n*   **A World of Constant Change:** The Renaissance was a time of great change and innovation.

He might have been recognized as a true genius, challenging the established norms of artistic appreciation.\r\n*   **A shift in the art market:** A successful Van Gogh would have undoubtedly changed the way art was bought and sold. His work might have become more expensive, and his name might have been attached to more prestigious galleries and auction houses.\r\n*   **A different trajectory for his mental health:** While we know that Van Gogh struggled with mental illness, his success might have alleviated some of the pressures and anxieties that he experienced. It's possible that he would have been able to continue to create without the constant fear of financial ruin or the need to hide his condition.\r\n*   **A more complete and nuanced body of work:** With a longer and more successful career, Van Gogh might have been able to explore a wider range of subjects and styles, resulting in a more complete and nuanced body of work.\r\n*   **A more positive legacy:** A more visible and respected artist would have had a more positive legacy for the art world. His work might have been seen as more uplifting and inspiring, and he might have been remembered as a true humanitarian.\r\n*   **A different style:** His style might have evolved in different directions, perhaps becoming more abstract or incorporating new techniques. It's impossible to say for sure, but it's possible that he would have become a completely different artist.\r\n*   **A more complete and nuanced life:** His life might have been less dramatic and more peaceful, with fewer setbacks and disappointments. This could have led to a more complete and nuanced life, with more time for personal growth and reflection.\r\n*   **A more complete and nuanced body of work:** With a longer and more successful career, Van Gogh might have been able to explore a wider range of subjects and styles, resulting in a more complete and nuanced body of work.\r\n*   **A more positive legacy:** A more visible and respected artist would have had a more positive legacy for the art world.

I just got back from the most incredible trip, and I\u2019m still dreaming of the turquoise waters and the warm smiles of the locals. Hawaii truly lives up to its reputation as a paradise.\r\n\r\nMy journey started in Oahu, where I spent a few days exploring the vibrant city of Honolulu. I visited the Pearl Harbor National Memorial, a sobering but important experience that gave me a deeper understanding of the history of the islands.\r\n\r\nNext, I took a flight to Maui, known as the \u201cValley Isle.\u201d The drive alone was breathtaking, with dramatic volcanic landscapes and lush rainforests.

Today, we\u2019re diving into a topic that\u2019s been reshaping how we discover, consume, and support music: the influence of streaming platforms.\r\n\r\nFor years, the music industry was a business based on physical sales \u2013 you bought a CD, you listened to it on the radio, and then you sold it back to the label. But with the rise of streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, the business model has completely changed.\r\n\r\nNow, the music industry is a subscription service. You pay a monthly fee, and you get access to a vast library of music. The label still exists, but they\u2019re now more of a curator and distributor.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll be discussing how these platforms have impacted artists\u2019 earnings, how they\u2019ve changed the way we discover new music, and what the future of the industry might look like.\r\n\r\n(Short musical interlude)\r\n\r\nHost: One of the biggest changes is the way artists are compensated. When you stream music, you\u2019re typically not paid a per-stream fee. Instead, the platform takes a cut of the revenue.\r\n\r\nThis means that many artists, especially those who don\u2019t have a huge following, are making very little money from streaming.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll be looking at some of the artists who have been particularly impacted by this shift, and we\u2019ll hear their perspectives on how streaming has affected their careers.\r\n\r\n(Short musical interlude)\r\n\r\nHost: But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. Streaming has also opened up access to music for millions of people around the world.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s made it easier than ever to discover new music, and it\u2019s given artists a way to connect directly with their fans.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll be looking at some of the ways in which streaming has fostered greater musical diversity and inclusivity.\r\n\r\n(Short musical interlude)\r\n\r\nHost: The future of the music industry is uncertain, but one thing is clear: streaming has fundamentally changed the way we experience music.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a complex and evolving landscape, and it\u2019s going to take time for the industry to fully adapt.\r\n\r\nBut one thing is certain: streaming is here to stay, and it\u2019s going to continue to shape the way we listen to and appreciate music.\r\n\r\n(Outro music and podcast jingle)"}, {"instruction": "Write a symphony concert review, discussing the orchestra's performance and overall audience experience.", "input": "", "generator": "combined_dataset_proportional_gemma_3.1B_it_ep5-greedy-long", "output": "The Chicago Symphony Orchestra delivered a truly remarkable performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor, 1943, a work that has become a cornerstone of the orchestra's repertoire.
