If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab.

Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won\u2019t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.\nDecrease the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don\u2019t panic\u2014it\u2019ll still be delicious, and you\u2019ll do better next time!\nLet the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You don\u2019t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if you\u2019re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you\u2019ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.\nIn a large heavy-bottomed saut\u00e9 pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator."}]}

Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If you\u2019re making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.\nWith your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining \u00bd cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl.\nFlour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball.\nLightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour.\nAfter 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter- turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour.\nRepeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it\u2019s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it\u2019s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.\nWipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don\u2019t deflate all the air inside.\nLightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of \u201ccage\u201d around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.\nSpace the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn\u2019t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they\u2019re pillowy.\nMeanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You\u2019re emulating a 700\u00b0F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.\nWhen the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don\u2019t manhandle it or you\u2019ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.\nWith firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it\u2019s about 6 inches across.\nThis next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions\u2014screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you\u2019re giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don\u2019t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it\u2014 it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it\u2019s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.\nUse tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.\nBake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature."}]}

(if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.\nRemove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.\nSet up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.\nIn a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Pur\u00e9e until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you\u2019re ready to serve.\nWhile the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Cut the bacon into \u00bc in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.\nIn a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.\nIncrease the heat slightly, and saut\u00e9 the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.\nThinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.\nTo serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it\u2019s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.\nThis works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you\u2019re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don\u2019t have an airlock, you\u2019ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks. Refrigerate indefinitely."}]}

Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil) and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes. Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.\nStrain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis."}]}

Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.\nTo make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1\u00bd tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.\nTrim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skin\u2014about \u215b inch/3mm away\u2014but not so close that it tears and won\u2019t hold its shape when it\u2019s stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You don\u2019t need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knife\u2014be sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!\nUse the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about \u215b inch/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about \u00bd inch/1cm from the end intact\u2014they need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.\nUsing your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about \u00bd inch/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.\nGently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They won\u2019t fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and soft\u2014test if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Don\u2019t worry if some of the rice/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.\nTo make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you don\u2019t want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic aside\u2014it will crisp up as it cools down\u2014and return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.\nWhen the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adha\u2014the coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlic\u2014then sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the yogurt spooned alongside."}]}

Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling. To prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.\nIf using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.\nMethod: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.\nTo Store: Use smaller (4 \u2013 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge. The pickle is ready to eat immediately after it is made, but the flavors are pronounced after a day or two. Serve using a clean and dry fork or spoon for each serving to avoid contamination."}]}

Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.\nPick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.\nDrain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then pur\u00e9e, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.\nAdd reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4\u20136 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.\nDo ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.\nHeat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7\u20139 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.\nWipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.\nTo cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles you\u2019re good to go. (It\u2019s important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If it\u2019s too hot, the batter will start to cook before it\u2019s fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous \u2153-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8\"-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle \u215b tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.\nServe dosas as they are ready with chutney alongside for dipping."}]}

Set aside.\nWith a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)\nSpread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.\nFire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need a low temperature of around 250 to 300\u00b0F (120 to 150\u00b0C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.\nDrain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.\nPlace the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300\u00b0F (120 and 150\u00b0C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.\nOnce the ribs are on, it\u2019s time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you don\u2019t, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.\nThe first batch of charcoal should be cooling down after 2 hours. Now is the time to use your chimney starter and get another batch of charcoal lit. Add the remaining wood chunks to the coals to get a little more smoke. If using a gas grill, wrap the remaining chips in foil and place directly on the hotter side of the grate. Close the lid and grill for another 2 hours. Make sure to come back every hour on the hour to check the temperature and to add more charcoal, if necessary. In the last hour of grilling, your ribs will start to show signs of cooking all the way through. When the meat pulls back from the bone, the ribs are almost ready. Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. I like to tent my ribs before serving, so take them off the grill and let them rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10 minutes."}]}

Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.\nTo make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it\u2019s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.\nTo make the pur\u00e9e, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to use it.\nTo make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn\u2019t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C). If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.\nRemove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don\u2019t panic\u2014this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.\nUnwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don\u2019t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it\u2019s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry pur\u00e9e on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.\nFrost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I\u2019ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season)."}]}

Place, oiled side down, on grill over direct heat and cook until large bubbles appear across surface, dough stiffens, and underside is dark brown, about 2 minutes. Brush top with oil, turn over, and cook just to lightly dry out second side, about 30 seconds.\nUsing tongs and a metal spatula, move dough over to cooler side of grill. Top with a spoonful of passata or burst cherry tomatoes and one quarter of cheese (either alone or in combination). Add pepperoni or salami (if using), then some of the lemony Swiss chard, and/or Rosemary Agrodolce as desired. Carefully slide pizza back over direct heat. Cook until cheese is melted and toppings are heated through, about 2 minutes. If dough is in danger of burning on underside but toppings need more time, return pizza to cooler side, cover grill, and cook another 1\u20132 minutes.\nTransfer pizza to a cutting board and drizzle with more oil. Top with basil and red pepper flakes if desired.\nRepeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more pizzas."}]}

Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about \u00bd\" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1\" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.\nCover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot. Let buns rise until they\u2019re doubled in volume and spring back when poked, leaving only a small indentation, 1\u20131\u00bd hours, depending on how warm and humid your kitchen is.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Bake buns, still covered, until puffed, pale, and mostly set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes if you prefer a soft and squishy bun and up to 25 minutes for a more toasted bun. Let cool slightly.\nMeanwhile, whisk powdered sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla in a medium bowl to combine.\nBrush glaze over warm buns and serve in skillet.\nDo Ahead: Pur\u00e9e can be made 3 days ahead. Place in an airtight container; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using."}]}

Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium until foaming, about 2 minutes. Add pistachios and cook, stirring often, until butter browns and nuts smell toasty, about 5 minutes. (Butter will get very foamy and it will be hard to see what\u2019s going on, so once the foam is golden brown, remove pan from heat every 10 seconds to check how the nuts are browning.) Pour mixture through prepared sieve, scraping in all of the browned bits; set nuts and butter aside.\nCrack eggs into a large bowl; add brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.

Lightly sprinkle both sides of the tofu with salt and transfer to a rack. Repeat to fry the remaining tofu. Wipe the skillet clean.\nOn a clean work surface, arrange two collard leaves lengthwise, overlapping each other by an inch or so, and place one piece of tofu in the center of the leaves.

{"dataset": "kfr", "id": "kfr_322", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Recipe for Crispy Tofu Balls"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " - 1 (19-ounce) package firm tofu\n - \u2153 cup finely chopped scallions\n - 5 \u2153 teaspoons mushroom bouillon\n - 4 tablespoons fresh corn, off the cob\n - 2 pinches ground white pepper\n - Spicy aioli, for garnish and dip\n - 1 cup all-purpose flour\n - 1 \u00bc cups water\n - 2 \u00bc teaspoons mushroom bouillon\n - 1 (12-ounce) package green glutinous rice flakes (aka com dep xanh)\n - \u00bd cup cornstarch\n\n\nPressing the tofu is the most important step, so I\u2019m going to give y\u2019all (I grew up in Texas, so I have the liberty to use \u201cy\u2019all\u201d liberally) three pressing options. The first step before you press is the same: Drain the liquid from the box of tofu. Then press.\nMethod 1: (Easiest) Use a tofu-pressing machine! I spotted one of these in Torrance, California, at a little Japanese grocery store. You place a block of tofu in between two plates and turn a small crank to compress it. Though it will press only one block at a time\u2014the boxes of tofu we use come four to a box\u2014you can set it and forget it (but do it three more times if you plan on using all the tofu).\nMethod 2: (Most common) Use two similar-size plates or relatively flat surfaces. Lay out the blocks of tofu flat in a single layer on one of the plates, and then put the second plate on top of the tofu. Press the tofu by placing at least 10 pounds of weight on top of the second plate.\nMethod 3: (Most \u201cprofessional\u201d) We still prepare the tofu this way at our restaurant, which is, without question, the most efficient way to prepare larger servings. Lay baking racks/grates inside baking sheets, then cover racks with clean (lint-free) towels or, as we did successfully for four years, with neatly folded aprons laid in a single layer as level and as flat as possible across the racks. Yup, towels or aprons, plural. Because tofu holds so much moisture, the liquid constantly spills over, and we\u2019ve found very few people who just live to clean. To absorb the moisture, and to create much less of a mess, we started using layers of cloth.\nLay out the tofu on the covered racks in a single layer, organized as tightly as possible. Make sure the tofu doesn\u2019t hang over the sides of the sheets or it won\u2019t be pressed evenly. Next, lay another towel/apron on top of the layer of tofu, again, flat and level. Then lay another equal-size baking sheet + covered rack + tofu on top of that. Repeat the same steps as needed. The top layer should be a baking sheet on which you place 30 to 40 pounds of \u201cstuff\u201d to press down on all the layers. No matter how many layers you stack, the tofu should flatten out only slightly, not be completely crushed.\nProcessing the tofu is far simpler than pressing it, though like pressing, there are three different ways to do it. Start with a bowl or a large (22-quart) plastic container made by and known as a Cambro (if you have one of those lying around), and do one of the following:\nMethod 1: Use a food mill, which is what we use. This is by far the easiest way to process tofu and get the most consistent texture (and it\u2019s a great method for mashing anything).\nMethod 2: Use a potato masher. Just mash away, but you\u2019ll still need to use the third option to smash out any little lumps that the masher doesn\u2019t, um, well, mash.\nMethod 3: Mash everything with your hands. (This is the most common way.)\nProcess the tofu until it is a consistent, almost pasty texture. If you go with No. 2 or No. 3, make sure to smash out all lumps from the tofu or else the seasoning won\u2019t evenly distribute throughout the mix and, later, the balls.\nAdd chopped scallions, mushroom bouillon, corn, and ground white pepper to the (hopefully) evenly processed tofu. Stick your hands in (maybe with gloves) and mix all the ingredients. Taste some of the mix from different areas of the bowl/container to make sure it\u2019s evenly seasoned. It should taste savory, with little bits of scallion and corn in every bite.\nNow it\u2019s ball-rolling time! Scoop out a tablespoon of the tofu mixture, hand-pack it tightly into the spoon, then level out the spoon with your finger. Assertively shake or scoop out the mix into your hand while mostly keeping it in one piece. Firmly clench the tofu by making a fist, packing it very tightly so it doesn\u2019t fall apart.\nContinue by shaping into a ball, either with one hand or by lightly tossing the ball back and forth between both hands like you\u2019re playing catch with yourself. Lightly roll the tofu between your hands, moving your hands in an alternating clockwise motion, like you would forming a meatball, only more gently to smooth out any cracks. Tofu is very docile; the more you do it, the better you\u2019ll get the feel of it (like most things in life). Place tofu balls on a plate or (ideally) a baking sheet rack.\nOptional: Refrigerate the balls overnight, uncovered. This will firm them up.\nAdd flour, water, and mushroom bouillon to a bowl. Mix together. It should not be lumpy; the consistency should be not too thin and consistently thick enough to adhere, but not so thick it doesn\u2019t drip off your finger.\nEmpty the green rice flakes into a separate bowl or catering pan, then mix in half of the dry cornstarch with flakes. Next, drop balls into flour paste. Shake off excess paste (we highly recommend using a kitchen \u201cspider\u201d strainer to do this), then roll balls around in the flakes until they\u2019re fully coated. Gently clench the balls to pack one last bit of flakes onto the balls. If flakes start to drop off the balls, mix in more of the remaining cornstarch to dry flakes, then try again.\nSet balls on a rack.\nOptional: If you plan on making more and hate waste like we do, clean and dry your hands, then sift through all the flakes. Throw out any moist clumps of flakes. Store dry flakes in a closed container, then refrigerate until your next tofu ball\u2013rolling party!\nOptional: Refrigerate the fully flaked balls uncovered (and preferably elevated on a rack) overnight. This will give the flakes more time to adhere and dry out, which is important in giving the balls more puff, crunch, and an overall prettier look after frying.\nAdd at least 2 inches of oil to a pot, bring to 350\u00b0F over high heat, then fry the balls for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the flakes puff up bright green and any exposed tofu turns a slight golden color. If the balls start turning brown, the oil\u2019s too hot or you\u2019re frying them for too long. If the balls look oily or wet after frying, either the temperature is too low or you\u2019re frying too many balls at once, which lowers the temperature of the oil too quickly.\nRemove from oil, shake off excess, drip dry on a rack. Plate and top with spicy aioli and more aioli on the side to dip."}]}

Cook, stirring constantly, until grains are translucent around the edges and make a clattering sound when they hit against the pot, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the water and egg white with your fingers. The flour will look shaggy, like biscuit dough; as the dough comes together, run an open palm around the edge of the bowl and fold the flour into the center, spinning the bowl with your other hand as you go, until it all forms a rough clump. It\u2019s fine if there are still pockets of dry flour.\nKnead the Dough: Coat your work surface with a fine dusting of flour and turn the dough out of the bowl. Dust your hands with flour and shape the dough into a fat log about the width of your hand. Knead the dough by pushing your hands and wrists into the log and rolling it forward. Then roll it back and push again. Repeat a few times until the log moves easily, adding more flour if it sticks, then spin the log 90 degrees, shape it into a horizontal log again, and knead a few more times, adding more flour if necessary. Use no more flour than you need to keep the dough from drying out. As you knead, the dough will get firmer and tougher with a texture reminiscent of a gummy bear. It\u2019s ready when it\u2019s smooth to the touch, like the surface of a pearl, not tacky, with no cracks or pockets of dry flour. There may be some lumps. Put the dough back in your work bowl and cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Let it sleep for 15 to 30 minutes. While it relaxes, you can prepare your filling.Knead Again: Dust your work surface with a little more flour, then knead it as before. Work out all those lumps; after kneading about ten times you should have satin-smooth dough that forms a clean ball you can easily push into, like the gel of a shoe insert.Portion the Dough: Form your dough into a log, dust a dough scraper with a little flour, and cut the dough into four equal sections. Roll each section into a log and chop it into six pieces for a total of twenty-four balls of dough, each about an inch in diameter. Toss the balls with a light coating of flour and cover with a lightly moistened towel.Roll the Dough Into Wrappers: Gently smash the balls of dough into flat disks, then lightly roll an Asian-style rolling pin across them to flatten them out a bit more. Hold one disk by its edge and firmly but gently roll your pin from the disk\u2019s edge to its center. Roll the same edge a few more times, using more pressure at the edge than at the center. Use your other hand to turn the dough disk and reveal a new edge of the disk; roll again. Continue until all edges are rolled out and the wrapper is about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Hold your rolled-out wrapper up to a light. If you can see through it faintly, your wrapper is ready to go. Otherwise, keep rolling. Roll the edges to half the thickness of the center of the wrappers. As you get faster, you\u2019ll notice that all your active hand needs to do is roll the pin back and forth while your other hand just rotates the wrapper. As long as your hands stay in these fixed motions, you\u2019ll easily make even, round wrappers though they don\u2019t need to be perfectly uniform. Place freshly rolled wrappers under a lightly moistened towel to keep them from drying out."}]}

Stir in the onion, lower the heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in the beans, salt, and pepper and cook until the beans absorb some of the seasoning and are hot all the way through, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.\nUsing a potato masher or an immersion blender, mash the beans in the pot to make a paste.

Next, pour the beautiful curry spice mix all over that chicken. Mix and rub the spices all over the chicken until no chicken remains uncovered with spice. Cover it all up, like it\u2019s your only goal in life.\nMarinate overnight. Alternatively, if you\u2019re in a hurry, marinate for 1 hour, though the curry mix won\u2019t fully penetrate the chicken or touch the souls of others, which is what eating is all about.\nWhen ready to cook, you\u2019ll need a pan to saut\u00e9 with and a pot for stewing and braising.\nCombine coconut milk, whole milk, and sambal badjak in pot.\nNext, heat the saut\u00e9 pan to medium-high heat. Add a little bit of cooking oil, add some onions and some lime leaves, and sear batches of chicken until chicken turns golden brown all around, while sweating onions and leaves. Do not cook the chicken through; just brown and sear. The lime leaves will fill your kitchen with their incredible citrus scent\u2014a pretty amazing smell.\nAfter each batch is evenly seared, transfer into pot. To ensure the chicken cooks evenly, do not heat up the pot until all chicken is seared. Continue searing onions, lime leaves, and chicken. Once all chicken is seared, saut\u00e9 any remaining lime leaves, and onions, and transfer to the pot before cooking. If there is any excess spice mix in the chicken marinade bowl, also transfer into the pot because the spice mix is measured specifically to give the best flavor for the curry sauce itself and not just the marinade.\nBring pot to a boil over high heat, then simmer covered with a slight opening for 35\u201345 minutes, or until the chicken is tender but not falling apart. The curry consistency should be thin and almost milky. Once chicken is done, turn off heat.\nWhile waiting for the chicken to finish cooking, prepare an ice water bath in a bowl. Bring 2 inches of water to a rolling boil in a pot over high heat. Cook the sweet potatoes in the boiling water for 6\u20138 minutes. Check often to see when the potatoes are cooked through; they should be crunchy, still firm and not mushy. Once they\u2019re done, remove the potatoes from pot (but do not dump the boiling water; save it for blanching the carrots) and shock them immediately in the ice water bath for 2 minutes, or until they are completely cool to the touch. Strain and set aside cooked potatoes in a fresh bowl.\nNext, blanch the carrots by repeating the steps as for the potatoes, checking for nonmushy doneness. If you use baby carrots, they take about 4\u20135 minutes to blanch. Adjust time accordingly for the type of carrots you\u2019re using and how they\u2019re cut. Cook, shock, strain, then set aside with the potatoes.\nChicken can be served immediately, but it will be most flavorful if cooled down, stored, and covered overnight in the fridge, and then reheated and served the next day. Blanched potatoes and carrots can also be stored overnight.\nWhen ready to serve (not long before\u2014just right when you are ready to serve), add carrots and potatoes to the hot chicken curry. Garnish with scallions. Serve with steamed rice, and if you want to soak up that curry deliciousness (my favorite part), sop it up with some Buttermilk Beer Beignets.\nAnd that\u2019s the best experience with chicken curry that you can have\u2014reaching the epitome of chicken curry enlightenment. Enjoy, kids!"}]}

Combine the pod, seeds, and milk in a medium saucepan and set it over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scalding. When it is almost at a simmer, turn off the heat. Place a sieve over the saucepan so that it dips into the milk but doesn\u2019t sink to the bottom, then add the chamomile tea. Let steep for 5 minutes.\nIn a medium bowl, using a handheld mixer or whisk, whisk the egg yolks, honey, and sugar until thick and velvety, about 2 minutes (you should see ribbons fall from the whisk). Add the flour and custard powder, then whisk until lump-free. Remove the chamomile and vanilla pods from the milk, then slowly pour 1/2 cup (120 mL) of the hot milk into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly until combined. Add the yolk mixture back to the pan, then set it over medium-low heat. Whisking constantly, let the mixture bubble gently until you have a thick custard (take the pot off the heat and whisk to blend if lumps start forming on the side of the pan). Turn off the heat and whisk in the unsalted butter, one tablespoon at a time, until evenly incorporated. Let cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. The custard can be made a couple of days ahead.\nWith a serrated knife, remove the crust from the bread on all sides, then cut the loaf into two 5-inch (13-cm) cubes. Try to keep the edges as straight as possible.\nIn a large bowl, whisk the milk, egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. On a rimmed baking sheet, scatter a thin layer of granulated sugar. Working one at a time, dip the bread cubes in the milk mixture for just a couple of seconds on each side, then place them on a baking sheet. With a spoon, scatter a generous but even layer of granulated sugar over each side (you need a good coating to get that hardened caramel shell).\nSet a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and add enough butter to thinly coat the surface. Use a flat spatula to gently place the coated bread cubes in the skillet, then fry on each side until the sugar is golden brown and caramelized. If you see burned sugar in the skillet as you cook, remove it with a spoon. Keep adding more butter as needed.\nLet the cubes cool slightly on a cooling rack (the caramel needs a couple of minutes to harden). They can be made 15 minutes before serving but no longer. Right before serving, cut out a 2-inch (5-cm) hole on one side of each cube, then remove about half of the bread from the interior (chopsticks are perfect for this job).

Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into eight pieces about 3.5 oz [100 g] each.\nTo shape the dough, cup the palm of your hand over one portion at a time and move your hand in a circle. The friction from the counter will help form the dough into a ball. If there is too much flour on the surface and the dough is sliding around, give the counter a spritz of water and try again. Lightly oil a rimmed tray and place the dough on the tray, ensuring that the portions are not touching. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap lightly coated with oil. Leave out for 1 to 1\u00bd hours, or until puffy, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. If you refrigerate the dough, use plastic wrap to cover it and expect it to take an hour or two to return to room temperature before it is ready to be rolled out.\nDust the counter lightly with flour. Pat a portion of dough into an oval with your fingertips. Using a rolling pin and moving back and forth, roll the dough as thinly as possible into an oval about 13 by 9 in [33 by 23 cm]. If the dough resists stretching, let it relax and start working on another portion before returning to it. You can also gently stretch the dough with your hands to correct the shape. It doesn\u2019t have to look perfect.\nPlace a carbon-steel wok upside down over a burner. Have a pair of tongs handy.\nHeat the wok over high heat for 1 minute or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.\nDrape the dough over the wok. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift it easily from the wok with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for another 30 seconds.\nTransfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, turn off the burner. The wok heats up quickly, and it will get too hot if the burner is left on.\nPlace a 20 in [50 cm] cast-iron griddle over two burners. Heat the griddle over medium-high heat for a few minutes or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.\nDrape the dough over the griddle. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift the dough easily with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for 30 more seconds.\nTransfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, keep the griddle turned on, but monitor its heat so it doesn\u2019t get too hot.\nHave tongs, a pastry brush, a small bowl of vegetable oil, and 2 half-sheet pans ready. Coat one of the pans lightly with oil.\nHeat a gas grill over medium-high heat or prepare a charcoal grill for direct-heat cooking. Ensure that the grill grates are clean. The grill should be hot enough that you can only hold your hand over the grates for 3 to 5 seconds. Place a sheet of dough onto the oiled pan and brush oil on top. Drape the oiled dough over the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 25 seconds. Uncover the grill. Using tongs, turn the lavash over and let it cook for another 25 seconds, uncovered, or until evenly blistered and puffed in parts.\nTransfer to the clean half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough.\nEat the lavash soon after making it or store it in plastic bags to keep the bread pliable. It\u2019s okay if it dries out and turns brittle; just rehydrate it by misting the lavash with water and covering it with a towel to let it soften. Soon after, it should be pliable enough to roll up without cracking. If it\u2019s still cracking, mist with more water."}]}

Add butter and toss to evenly coat. Working quickly and aggressively, use your fingers to rub butter into flour to create large shaggy pieces of dough (you want some pieces of butter that are flat and thin and some that are large and chunky). Drizzle 5 Tbsp. ice water over, running your fingers through flour mixture to evenly distribute. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it should look a little dry, but add more ice water by the teaspoonful if needed, just until dough comes together).\nTurn dough out onto a work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times, pressing to incorporate shaggy edges and any loose bits. Dust surface and dough lightly with flour to keep dough from sticking. Using your hands, form dough into about a 7x5\" rectangle.

Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until edges of crust start to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove parchment and weights. Decrease oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and bake crust until edges are golden, 20\u201325 minutes. Remove dish from oven and brush 1 Tbsp. egg white over bottom of crust. Return to oven and bake until crust is golden brown, 5\u201310 minutes (the egg creates a water-resistant coating that helps prevent the custard from making the bottom soggy). Reserve remaining egg white for topping.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 3 days ahead; store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\nWhile your crust is baking, combine eggs, egg yolk, pie filling, cream, granulated sugar, whiskey, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, 6 Tbsp. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. butter, and \u00bd tsp.

It\u2019s important to add them one at a time so that they will completely incorporate into the batter and you don\u2019t put too much weight on your batter at once. This would collapse all the little air bubbles you created when you creamed the butter and sugar.\nReduce the speed to low.

Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then gradually add one third of the hot water, beating until well incorporated. Add another third of the flour mixture, followed by one third of the hot water. It\u2019s important to add the flour and water little by little like this, so that your batter does not have too much weight thrown on it and that you allow each amount of flour and water to completely mix into the batter. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Add the remaining flour mixture, followed by the remaining hot water, and beat just until combined.\nUsing a spatula, fold the grated apple into the batter. Take care not to overmix the batter. If you overmix the batter, the cupcakes will not be light and fluffy but instead very dense.\nUse a standard-size ice-cream scoop to fill each baking cup with batter, so the cups are two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes (start checking at 15 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. After 5 minutes, transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely for approximately 20 minutes. It\u2019s always best to cool the cupcakes at room temperature. Putting them in the refrigerator to cool can dry out the cake.\nPlace all ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until well combined. Be sure to beat on high speed at the very end for at least 2 minutes to ensure that the frosting is light and fluffy.\nPour the sugar and water into a large saucepan.

Sprinkle a 1/2-inch layer of the mixture in the baking dish and lay the salmon on top, skin side down. Pack the fish in the rest of the salt-sugar-shiso mixture and cover loosely with a large piece of plastic wrap. You need to weight down the salmon, which you can go about in a couple different ways: A) If you have a dish or container that is slightly smaller than the one the salmon is sitting in, set the smaller container on top of the fish and weight it down with a few cans or a brick; B) Alternatively, fill a large zip-top bag three-quarters full with cold water and seal. Nestle the bag over the piece of fish. If the bag hangs over the sides of the baking dish, pour out some of the water and reseal. In either case, wrap the whole apparatus tightly in plastic wrap and allow the fish to cure in the refrigerator for 1 day.\nAfter a day, unwrap the fish and flip it over, being sure all the flesh comes into contact with the curing mix (which should be mostly liquid at this point). Weight the fish down again and wrap it again in fresh plastic. Cure in the fridge for 3 or 4 more days, depending on the thickness of your fillet. The gravlax is ready when the fish is firm to the touch.\nWipe the cure off the salmon and wrap it in clean plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to serve. It will keep for up to a week.\nPulse the dried onion in a food processor or spice grinder five times, or until powdery. Transfer to a bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and stir well. Store in an airtight container for up to a couple weeks. Give it a good shake before serving.\nWorking in batches, use a mortar and pestle, food processor, or spice grinder to pulverize the katsuobushi flakes into a fine powder. Transfer to a bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and stir well. Store in an air-tight container for up to a week.\nSet out a spread of the sliced bagels and toppings and let people do as they please."}]}

Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C/Gas mark 6). Drizzle 2 teaspoons of olive oil over or add a pat (knob) of butter to the mushroom and season with salt and pepper before roasting for 12 to 15 minutes, until softened. If you are using the oven, begin roasting the mushroom and tomatoes a few minutes before frying the sausages and bacon. Once cooked, decrease the oven temperature to low for keeping everything warm as it is cooked.\nTo fry an egg, melt a pat (knob) of butter in a small, clean frying pan over low heat. Carefully crack the egg into the pan and allow to fry gently. For an over-easy egg, fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it begins to set, then flip over and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. If you prefer your egg sunny side up, then fry gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until the yolk has filmed over. Remove from the pan and serve immediately with the other cooked ingredients.\nFor scrambled eggs, crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk, season with salt and pepper, and beat together. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to a small saucepan over low heat. Immediately pour in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously (I find a wooden spatula best for this), until the butter has melted and the eggs are softly scrambled. Remove from the heat immediately so that the eggs don't become overcooked. Serve with the other cooked ingredients.\nWhile the egg is cooking, put the slices of bread in a toaster or toast under a preheated broiler (grill) for a few minutes (and on both sides, if using the broiler/grill) until golden. Butter the toast and cut the slices in half.\nTo serve, arrange everything on a warm serving plate, with the hot buttered toast on the side and with some tomato ketchup or relish."}]}

Soak (aka let the gelatin bloom) for 5\u20137 minutes, or until the sheets soften. To prevent sheets from breaking down, drain water immediately after the 5\u20137 minutes and gently wring out remaining water from the sheets, just like you were wringing out a towel.\nIf using powdered gelatin, place gelatin in a bowl and add 1/3 cup heavy cream.

Like the Salted Plum Sauce, the milk, sugar, and heavy cream should steam but not boil. If you have a thermometer, DO NOT go over 145\u00b0F.\nNext, add gelatin (sheets or powdered in heavy cream), then whisk until gelatin dissolves. This will take a few minutes.\nRemove from heat, then immediately add lychee puree while the cream is still warm. Mix gently with a spatula.\nLadle into ramekins, small bowls, your preferred fancy or not-so-fancy container, or into your pre-oil-brushed mold.\nRefrigerate, carefully. Gelatin is fairly docile and irritably unstable. As it cools, however, panna cotta should solidify within an hour.\nIf after 2 hours it still hasn\u2019t settled, don\u2019t fret\u2014you can still recover. Recombine the cream in a pot and warm to right below boiling. Add a tad bit more (bloomed) gelatin, then remove from heat. Repour into molds. Be careful not to add too much gelatin, which will result in a stiff, less creamy panna cotta, more of a superstiff Jell-O than panna cotta.\nGarnish with a thin layer of Salted Plum Sauce on top of your final plating\u2014do fancy dots or a paintbrush swipe if you would like\u2014and edible flowers (if you somehow got these) and pomegranate seeds (if in season and available).

Wrap logs in plastic wrap and chill until very firm, at least 2 hours.\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Working one at a time, unwrap dough and brush with egg. Carefully sprinkle surface with sanding sugar and roll logs in sugar to coat well (really press dough into sugar so it sticks). Slice into rounds a generous 1/4\" thick, rotating after every few cuts to keep slices round. Arrange cookies on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2\" apart. Bake, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until edges are just set, 12\u201314 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.\nDough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled.

If convection is an option, choose it.\nMake the ducks. Cut away the flap of fatty skin from the neck, and scrape any loose fat from inside the cavities. Prick the skin all over gently with a sharp fork, or cross-hatch it with a sharp knife. Be careful not to pierce the meat.\nFill an 18-quart stock pot (or as large as you have) about two-thirds full with water, and add the salt. Place the bunches of thyme and rosemary and the garlic cloves in it. Bring to a rapid boil. (You may need to use two pots if you do not have a single pot large enough to hold both ducklings at once; if so, divide the thyme and rosemary into smaller held-together bunches, and divide the garlic between the pots.) Place the ducks in the pot. If they pop up, keep them submerged using a smaller pot full of water or some other weight. Be aware of overflow. Bring the water back to a slow boil. Simmer the ducks for about 30 minutes. Remove them, and use paper towels to dry them thoroughly.\nStuff each of the ducks\u2019 cavities with half of the boiled thyme, rosemary, and garlic and the quartered orange.\nLine the bottom of a large shallow roasting pan with the onions, carrots, and the orange rounds. Place the ducks, breast-side down, on top. Massage them with the Cointreau. This will give them a mahogany finish. Let them sit for 10 minutes for the skin to absorb the liqueur. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nRoast until the bottoms brown, about 20 minutes. Turn them breast-side up, and lower the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Several times during roasting, spoon off any excess fat as it accumulates, or suck it up using a baster. Use some of the fat to baste the ducks, and set the rest aside, saving some for the sauce.\nDepending on how long you boiled the ducks and the size of the ducks, roasting time will be another hour or longer. The ducks are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers at least 180\u00b0F, or until the juices run clear and the leg bones wiggle easily. You want the meat to slide off the bones. Don\u2019t be afraid of overcooking these. Ducks don\u2019t dry out easily. The skin should be crisp. If not, no worries. You will pass the pieces under the broiler before serving. (If the ducks are too crisp and the meat is not finished cooking, cover them with foil as you continue roasting.) Once the ducks are ready, remove them from the oven, and cover them with aluminum foil while you finish the sauce.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce. Combine the stock, giblets, and necks in a saucepot over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle boil, until the stock is reduced by half.\nFinish the sauce when you have retrieved rendered duck fat from the roasting duck. In a medium saucepan, warm the duck fat over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking with a fork as you do so. Remove the giblets and necks from the stock reduction, and discard. Add the stock to the duck fat\u2013flour mixture, raise the heat to medium-high, and stir continuously to prevent lumps as you bring it to a slow boil. Add the Cointreau, vinegars, orange juice, marmalade, and orange peel to the pan. Bring back to a boil, melting the marmalade, then simmer uncovered on low heat until the sauce thickens and is reduced. Preheat a broiler with the rack set a notch or two down from the top position.\nWhen the ducks have rested at least 20 minutes, use a sharp knife or poultry scissors to split them and cut the breasts from the legs. Discard the orange quarters, herbs, wings, and any pockets of fat that remain. Slip the breast meat from the bones. Leave the legs intact. Put a little sauce in a broiling pan, and lay the duck pieces on top. Spoon a little sauce on top of each piece. Put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp and glaze. Watch them carefully; the sugar in the sauce caramelizes quickly.\nPlace the pieces on a platter, and decorate with thin, round slices of orange. Serve with additional sauce on the side."}]}

Lightly dust a work surface with flour and place the pasta sheet on it. Using a star-shaped plunger cutter in any size you prefer, make star cutouts all over the sheet of pasta. I recommend spacing the star cutouts as close together as possible, because the sheet will get re-rolled and the stars will expand (doesn\u2019t stars expanding blow your mind?). Cover this sheet with a kitchen towel. If you wish, save the tiny cutout stars to make pastina.\nRoll the second dough on a pasta machine until it is the same size as the sheet with the star cutouts. Uncover the cutout pasta sheet and moisten it slightly with a kitchen brush dipped in water or a damp paper towel. Taking care to cover the cutout sheet precisely, lay the newly rolled sheet over the cutout sheet. Use a rolling pin to sandwich the two sheets together, rolling both lengthwise and crosswise.\nOnce you are sure the two sheets are sufficiently pressed together, use a bench scraper to carefully turn the pasta sheet over, revealing the star pattern. You may be able to make nips, tucks, and small adjustments at this point if you notice any bunching up of the pattern. Dust with flour as necessary to prevent sticking.\nRoll the sheet through the pasta machine again, starting on the widest setting. Reduce the rollers to the second-widest setting and roll the opposite end of the sheet through first this time. Alternating the sides of the sheet you put through the pasta machine will ensure that the stars don\u2019t skew too much in one direction. Keep reducing the rollers until you\u2019ve rolled the pasta sheet through the middle thickness on the pasta machine. Your stars will look wide! Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019re about to fix that.\nLay the pasta sheet flat on your work surface and cut the whole sheet crosswise in 5-inch widths (or wider, up to the width of your pasta machine rollers). The star pattern has so far been skewed only side to side, making really wide stars, so now we\u2019ll run the 5-inch sheets crosswise through the pasta machine, to stretch the stars back toward symmetry.\nFeed the 5-inch widths of pasta through the pasta machine crosswise this time, perpendicular to the direction you had been feeding them through initially. Watch the star pattern and stop sheeting at your desired thinness, depending on how stretched or skewed you want the stars. I suggest stopping at the second-or third-thinnest setting.\nWorking with one sheet at a time, cut lengthwise strips 3/4 to 1 inch wide. Hang the noodles to rest on a pasta drying rack, dowel, or the back of a chair and repeat the process with the remaining pasta sheets.\nLet the pappardelle rest for 30 minutes hanging, then gently place them on a parchment-lined and semolina-dusted sheet pan. You can boil them at this point or wait up to 2 hours at room temperature before boiling. If you would like to cook them another day, after they are leathery to the touch and no longer sticky, store the pasta on a sheet pan covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Increase the cooking time by 1 minute if working with refrigerated pasta.\nBoil in salted water for 2 minutes, drain, dress, and serve immediately."}]}
